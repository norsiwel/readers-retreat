September 18, 1973, Memphis, Tn.

The rain fell in heavy sheets across the city, washing the grime from cracked sidewalks into overflowing gutters. Fifteen-year-old Elise Marlowe hunched against the downpour, her thin jacket doing little to shield the bundle in her arms. The baby—her son—was only hours old, his tiny face peaceful in sleep, unaware of the chaos surrounding him.  Elise stopped at the stone steps of St. Michael's Church. Its weathered facade loomed before her, the stained glass windows dark in the stormy night. The single light above the entrance cast a weak halo through the rain.  "I'm sorry," she whispered, brushing her fingers against her son's cheek. "I can't take care of you. I can barely take care of myself." Her voice broke. "Maybe they can give you what I can't."  She placed the bundle in the small alcove by the door, sheltered from the rain. She'd wrapped him carefully in the only clean blanket she owned, tucked a small note beside him with a single word: Carl.  Elise rang the bell, then fled into the shadows across the street. She watched as Father Thomas opened the door, his expression shifting from annoyance to concern as he discovered the child. The priest gathered the baby into his arms, looking around frantically before retreating inside with her son.  As the church door closed, Elise turned away, tears mingling with raindrops on her face. She didn't know that in leaving her son at this particular church, she had set him on a path that would eventually lead to violence beyond imagination.  She didn't know that the orphanage connected to St. Michael's would close two years later after allegations of abuse. She didn't know that Carl would bounce through seven foster homes in the next ten years. She didn't know that her son would grow up believing he'd been thrown away, unwanted from the very beginning.  She only knew she couldn't be his mother. Not now. Not like this.
September 18th, 2023, Memphis, Tn.
The apartment was sparse, almost clinical in its minimalism. No photographs adorned the walls. No unnecessary furniture cluttered the space. The only personal touch was a small collection of antique timepieces arranged meticulously on a shelf.  Carl "Shadow" Cross sat at his desk, the blue light from his computer screen casting harsh shadows across his weathered face. At fifty, the lines around his eyes and mouth told stories of hardship and violence. His hands, steady and scarred, carefully cleaned a disassembled handgun—a ritual he performed after every job. The apartment's silence was broken by the sharp, metallic tink as Carl pressed the metal punch against the gun's carriage. His hand, steady and practiced, applied precise pressure. A tiny, new star was born, etched into the steel beside its brethren. He leaned closer, the dim light glinting off the freshly made mark. It was almost too small to see, a secret known only to him. Another life, another star. He didn't dwell on the face, the name, the circumstances. Those details blurred together, a hazy backdrop to the cold, hard reality of the star itself.  He ran a calloused thumb across the constellation of tiny marks, each one a testament to his proficiency, his purpose. Some were deep, sharp lines, fresh wounds in the metal. Others were worn smooth, their edges softened by time and countless cleanings. He paused at a particularly jagged star, a reminder of a kill that had lingered, a shadow in the back of his mind. He shook his head, pushing the memory away. Tonight, there was only the new star, the one he had just added. A fresh mark, a clean slate. Or so he told himself.  The gun, disassembled and spread across his work surface, was his canvas, his ledger, his confession. Each star a tally mark in a life lived in shadows. He picked up a cleaning cloth, the scent of gun oil filling the air. It was a ritual, a way to impose order on the chaos he had wrought. But tonight, the stars seemed to mock him, their silent presence a constant, glittering accusation."   The notification on his secure terminal chimed softly. Carl reassembled the weapon with practiced efficiency before turning to the message.
Tomorrow. 11:00. The usual place.
It was from Mr. Black, a client he'd worked with for the past decade. The jobs were always clean, the details precise, the payment generous. No questions asked. No answers given.
Carl replied with a single word: Confirmed.  
The café was nearly empty when Carl arrived. He spotted Mr. Black immediately—a tall, elegant man in his sixties with steel-gray hair and eyes that seemed to hold knowledge beyond their years.  Shadow," Mr. Black greeted him, using the code name that had become Carl's identity in certain circles.
"You have a job for me," Carl stated. It wasn't a question.
Mr. Black slid a small device across the table. It resembled a wristwatch but with an unusual interface—no traditional dial, just a strange, luminescent display.  "This," Mr. Black explained, "is called Chronos. It's cutting-edge technology. More advanced than anything you've used before."  Carl picked up the device, examining it with practiced indifference. "What's the target?"  "Elise Marlowe." Mr. Black produced a photograph of a young woman, perhaps in her mid-twenties. She was beautiful, with dark hair and intense eyes. "June 17, 1983. You need to prevent her marriage."  Carl raised an eyebrow. "Prevent her marriage? That's not my usual line of work."  "The payment will be substantial. Five times your usual fee."  Carl's expression remained impassive, but his mind raced. Something about this job felt wrong, but the money was too good to pass up.  "Fine. How does this work?" He held up the Chronos device.  "Set the date and location. Press the center button. The device will do the rest." Mr. Black stood. "One more thing—this will be your final job. After this, you'll be free."  As Mr. Black left, Carl studied the photograph again. Something about the woman's eyes seemed familiar, but he couldn't place it. He'd done "perfect murders" for two decades now—deaths that appeared to be natural causes, accidents, or the work of someone else. He'd stopped feeling anything about them years ago.  Back in his apartment, Carl packed a small bag with period-appropriate clothing and the tools of his trade. He programmed the Chronos device as instructed and pressed the center button.  The world around him blurred and dissolved, colors and shapes stretching until they snapped like rubber bands. For a moment, there was nothing but silent darkness.  Then, reality reassembled itself around him.
June 16th, 1983, Oakland, Ca.  
     Elise Marlowe hummed a nonsense tune as she dusted, her fiances apartment, picking up after a bachelor was something that she was familiar with and she thought to herself that soon all that would change.  Richard’s study was a sanctuary he rarely allowed her to enter, a space filled with the scent of aged leather and the quiet hum of unseen technology. Today, however, the door stood slightly ajar, an anomaly that piqued Elise’s curiosity. She hesitated, a flicker of guilt warring with an insistent urge to know more, before slipping inside.  The room was a labyrinth of mahogany shelves, overflowing with books and strange, metallic contraptions. On his desk, nestled amongst scattered papers and diagrams, lay a device unlike anything she had ever seen. It wasn’t a watch, not precisely, though it bore a similar shape. Its surface was a smooth, obsidian-like material, and a faint, ethereal glow pulsed from a luminescent display. Strange, intricate symbols flickered across the screen, a language she didn’t recognize, an alien script that seemed to hum with an inner power.  Elise cautiously reached out, her fingers hovering just above the cool surface. As she brushed her fingertips across the device, the symbols on the display intensified, swirling and shifting like constellations in a miniature galaxy. A faint hum resonated through the room, and a sudden flash of light, too quick to fully register, sparked in the air before her. It was a distorted image, a brief glimpse of something impossible, something that made her breath catch in her throat.  A wave of unease washed over her. She quickly pulled her hand away, the device settling back into its quiescent state. "She noticed a small, almost imperceptible seam along the side of the device. With a surge of nervous energy, she found a small paperclip on the desk, and slid it into the seam. A small hidden compartment popped open. Inside, she found folded schematics and pages filled with complex equations and diagrams. Words like 'temporal displacement' and 'chronological paradox' were scattered throughout. More disturbingly, tucked among the technical papers, were fragmented journal entries or contingency plans. Phrases like 'Marlowe Anomaly,' 'loop iteration 7,' and references to an 'operative—Asset C.' then she saw the name 'Carl' tied to her abandonment year, chilling her to the bone. She pieced together a horrifying picture: Richard wasn't just dabbling in time; he seemed to be orchestrating events, perhaps even targeting her, or someone connected to her, in a repeating cycle. A cold dread settled over her. Richard wasn't just a wealthy industrialist; he was something else entirely. Something... other, and terrifyingly manipulative. She quickly slid the schematics and notes back into place, closing the compartment. She had to get out of here. She had to understand what she had just seen, what Richard truly was. As she slipped out of the study, she knew that her engagement was built on a foundation of lies, and she was determined to uncover the truth."

June 17th, 1983, Oakland, Ca.

The motel room was exactly what one would expect in 1983—wood paneling, a garish bedspread, and a television set that looked like furniture. Carl checked his reflection in the bathroom mirror. The journey had left him disoriented but physically intact.  He'd arrived in June 1983, Oakland, California—just as planned.  Over the next few days, Carl surveilled his target. Elise Marlowe was a rising star in local politics, already making a name for herself at 25. Her upcoming marriage to industrialist Richard Black was the social event of the season.  Richard Black. Mr. Black.  Carl felt the first twinge of unease. This couldn't be coincidence.  On the third day, as Carl monitored Elise's apartment from across the street, she emerged and walked directly toward his surveillance position. Before he could move, she was standing before him.  "I know why you're here," she said calmly. "You're here to kill me."  Carl maintained his composure, despite his surprise. "I don't know what you're talking about."  Elise smiled sadly. "I know who sent you. I know who you are, Carl."  The use of his real name startled him. He instinctively reached for his concealed weapon.  "That won't be necessary," she continued. "There's something you need to know before you complete your mission." She paused, her eyes searching his face. "I'm your mother."  Carl froze, his hand still hovering near his weapon. "That's impossible."  "I abandoned you on the steps of St. Michael's Church in 1973. You were just a few hours old."  The world seemed to tilt beneath Carl's feet. Memories of orphanages and foster homes flashed through his mind. The abuse, the loneliness, the rage that had shaped him into the killer he'd become.  "If you're my mother, why would Mr. Black send me to kill you?"  "Because Richard—Mr. Black—is from 2053. He's trying to prevent a future that you create." Elise's voice was steady. "You're caught in a time loop, Carl. A loop that Richard designed."  She explained that in her timeline, she married Richard Black, who later developed the early prototype of time travel technology. Their marriage ended bitterly when she discovered his obsession with manipulating time. Decades later, he'd send her son back to prevent their marriage—erasing their relationship from history while preserving his control of the technology.  "He never knew you were my son," she said. "I made sure of that. But I've been waiting for you. I knew he'd send someone eventually."  "If you abandoned me, how did you know to expect me?" Carl's voice was cold.  "Because I saw what happened to you. After I left you, I tried to find you years later. I saw what the system had done to you. I decided then that I would never be a mother again—I couldn't bear causing another child that kind of pain." She looked at him with eyes full of regret. "But I also promised myself that if I ever got the chance to make things right, I would."  "I want to show you something," Elise said after they'd talked for hours.  She led Carl to a modest house in the suburbs. Through the window, they could see a woman—Elise, ten years older than the one standing beside him—and a boy of about ten.  "That's me," she explained. "The me from 1983. And that's you."  Carl stared at the boy. He had forgotten what he looked like as a child—thin, serious, with watchful eyes that seemed to anticipate danger at every turn.  "How is this possible?" he asked.  "The time loop is more complicated than you realize. There are multiple versions of us existing simultaneously. Richard wanted to ensure his plan would work no matter what variable changed."  The gravity of his situation began to sink in. "He sent me to kill my own mother, knowing it would erase my existence."  "Yes. And he knew you'd accept the job because of your hatred for the mother who abandoned you." Elise's eyes filled with tears. "He manipulated both of us."  Carl watched the boy—his younger self—helping his mother with dishes. There was a tentative happiness between them, nothing like the childhood he remembered.  "What happens if I complete the mission?" he asked.  "You'll cease to exist. This timeline will collapse. And Richard will maintain control of time travel technology, using it to reshape reality as he sees fit."  Carl made his decision. He would confront his younger self and explain everything.  That night, Carl broke into the house while Elise was away. He found his younger self alone in his bedroom, reading a book.  The boy looked up, startled but not afraid. "Who are you?"  "Someone who wants to help you," Carl replied, suddenly uncertain how to proceed.  Before he could explain further, young Carl reached for a baseball bat beside his bed. "My mom said people might try to hurt us. That's why we move a lot."  "I'm not here to hurt you," Carl said, raising his hands. "I'm here to protect you."  "Mom!" the boy shouted. "Mom!"  The door burst open, and Elise—the 1983 Elise—rushed in. She froze when she saw Carl.  "He's you," the older Elise said from the doorway behind Carl. "He's Carl from the future."  The 1983 Elise pulled her son behind her protectively. "That's impossible."  "Richard sent him to kill you," older Elise explained. "To prevent your marriage."  Young Carl, sensing his mother's fear, suddenly lunged forward with the bat. In the ensuing struggle, he accidentally pushed Carl toward the open window. Carl, caught off guard, lost his balance and fell.  As he plummeted, something strange happened. His body began to shimmer and fade. The time loop was breaking, reality rewriting itself. Carl felt no pain, only a strange sense of peace. In his final moments, he realized that by choosing not to kill his mother—by choosing to protect his younger self—he had given himself the second chance he never thought possible.  As Carl vanished from existence, erased from the timeline, so too did Mr. Black in 2023 and all the futures beyond.
       Young Carl dropped the bat, staring at the window in horror. "I didn't mean to—"
But there was no body on the ground below. No evidence that anyone had been there at all.
The older Elise had vanished as well, leaving only the 1983 Elise and her son in the bedroom.
"Mom?" young Carl asked, confused and frightened. "What just happened?"  Elise put her arms around her son, holding him close. "I think... I think we're free now."  In the days that followed, Elise canceled her engagement to Richard Black. She reported her encounters with the time travelers to no one, knowing she would sound insane. Instead, she focused on her son, determined to give him the love and stability he deserved.  Years passed. The timeline had been altered. Carl grew up with his mother's guidance and support, becoming not an assassin but a physicist specializing in theoretical quantum mechanics. The darkness that had consumed his other self never took root.  On his fiftieth birthday, Carl stood in his mother's garden. Elise, now in her seventies, sat nearby, watching butterflies flit among her flowers.  "Do you ever think about that night?" Carl asked. "The night with the man who fell?"  Elise smiled gently. "Sometimes. It feels like a dream now."  "I've been working on something at the lab," Carl said. "A theory about temporal mechanics. Sometimes I wonder if it's connected  somehow."  "Perhaps some knowledge is better left undiscovered," Elise suggested.  Carl nodded, looking up at the clear blue sky. "Perhaps. Or perhaps some knowledge finds us when we're ready for it."  In his pocket was a small device he'd been developing—nothing like the Chronos, but based on similar principles. Unlike Richard Black, Carl had no intention of manipulating time. His research was focused on understanding it, respecting its boundaries.  Elise reached for her son's hand, squeezing it gently. "Whatever you discover, I know you'll use it wisely."  Carl returned the squeeze, grateful for the life he'd been given—a life made possible by a man who had chosen death so that he might live.  "I will, Mom," he promised. "I will."
