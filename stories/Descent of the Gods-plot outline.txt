I. THE PROLOGUE (The Ancient Past & The Seeds of Conflict)
* The Gods Arrive (3790 BCE – c. 2500 BCE):
* Shapers (Khem-Ur) land in Nile Delta.
* Humans enslaved, build pyramids for gold.
* Shapers are nearing depletion of gold in North Africa.
* They face an emerging threat from other cosmic powers
(Whisperers/Stone-Weavers, though perhaps not named or fully understood by
humans at this point, just felt as pressure by the Shapers).
* Shapers choose to depart Earth, leaving dormant tech and a legacy of "gods
who left."
* (The reader knows they left under duress and due to resource issues; their
ultimate fate – being destroyed later by their enemies – is a mystery to be
revealed in Pacha's time).
* The New Masters (190 BCE – 500 CE):
* Whisperers (Tikaq Runa) land in Andes.
* Stone-Weavers (Balam K'uh) land in Mesoamerica.
* Alien-worshipping empires rise (Egypt continuing its legacy, Maya, Aztec,
Inca).
II. THE HERO'S JOURNEY (Pacha's Saga & The First Liberation – c. 500 CE –
1134 CE)
* Act I: The American Awakening (500–1120 CE):
* Discovery of shared alien heritage.
* The Pact of Tawantinsuyu-Hanal K'uh.
* Tech leap, Federation expansion.
* European encounter.
* Pacha’s Call to Adventure: Deciphers Shaper coordinates, illegal gate jump
to Egypt, discovers the ruins and the "graveyard of gods." This is the
threshold crossed.
* Act II: Forging Alliances & The Alien War (1120 CE – c. 1130 CE):
* Pacha's report, council reactions.
* The Gate Wars begin (League expedition to Giza, European "Crusade").
* Major Revelation: Pacha (and humanity) discovers the Shapers were ultimately
destroyed/crippled by the Whisperers/Stone-Weavers. This raises the stakes
immensely.
* Pacha's diplomatic mission to Europe, the War Council of Rome.
* The full alien onslaught (Stone-Weaver quakes, Whisperer plagues).
* Humanity’s desperate counterstrikes, betrayals, sacrifices (Lady K'abel).
* Discovery of alien weakness (iron).
* Act III: Humanity's Gambit & Victory (c. 1130 CE – 1134 CE):
* New weapons of rebellion.
* Siege of Tenochtitlan.
* Operation Stormheaven: Assault on the Whisperer mothership.
* Pacha’s discovery about Whisperer/Stone-Weaver motives/nature.
* Pacha's climactic choice/negotiation.
* Aliens withdraw/defeated.
III. THE UNEASY VICTORY & THE LONG VIGIL (The Aftermath & The New "Prologue"
– 1134 CE – 2125 CE)
* A Fractured Utopia (Immediate Post-War):
* The Pan-Human Concord, social shifts, new faiths.
* Rebuilding a world, integrating/studying alien tech.
* Pacha's fate (legend, martyr, explorer).
* The Sword Hanging Over Earth (The Centuries of Waiting):
* The four threats in the stars (Whisperers' Vow, Stone-Weavers on Mars,
possible Shaper remnants/legacy tech going haywire, Human Hubris/arms race).
* Legacy tech, societal evolution, the Stellar Concord, monuments.
* The ghosts in the machine, the unanswered questions.
* A culture of vigilance.
* The Climax of this "Uneasy Victory" Era / Inciting Incident for the Next Saga
(2125 CE):
* Lunar Observatory "Pachacuti's Eye."
* Dr. Kimi Xochitl & Eli "Stonefist."
* "It’s not scouts. It’s a... harvest fleet. Size: Category Omega."
* Earth’s defenses activating.
* OVERLAY TEXT: "END OF PROLOGUE" (This "prologue" refers to the entire
~1000-year arc from Pacha to 2125 CE, setting up the new main story).
This structure is powerful because:
• The Ancient Prologue (Shapers) sets the stage and the mystery.
• The Hero's Journey (Pacha) is a complete, epic saga in itself, showing
humanity's incredible fight for freedom.
• The Uneasy Victory provides a realistic aftermath, showing that victory
has costs and new challenges, and beautifully transitions into the "present
day" of your next major conflict, giving that conflict immense historical
weight.
It makes the "END OF PROLOGUE" in 2125 CE incredibly impactful because the
reader has just witnessed the entirety of what humanity went through to get to
that point of readiness. Excellent framework!
