### **Structural Notes**
- **Alien Design:** Kaelons communicate via bioluminescent patterns. Worship
manifests as synchronized light-rituals.
- **Time Dilation:** Use chapter subtitles (e.g., *"Kaelon Year 14,302: The
Great Doubting"*) to imply scale.
- **Ethan’s Growth:** His star-form reflects his journey – calm yellow
dwarf (wisdom) with occasional flares (passion).
