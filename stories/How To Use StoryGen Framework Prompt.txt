                                    How to us the StoryGen Framework prompt

The storygen framework prompt is not an automatic story generator, you
still need to create the story and work with the AI to produce it.  I use an
outline and submit to the AI item by item, this method works very well.  But
you can also wing it, but you have to give the AI very specific instructions if
you want good results.  For instance, in the first prompt you need to lay out
the scene and characters and actions, I.e :  Bob and Sally on the front porch,
drinking coffee the paperboy rides by on his bike and throw s the paper onto
the porch, Bob’s POV, mood serene,detailed, show don’t tell.  This
framework does not write the stories, you do that, but the AI helps you by
generating great prose, if you use the right one.
To be clear, this does not replace the writer, you have to create the
plot, the characters, the settings, and you can even input the exact dialog for
dialog scenes, experiment with it, enjoy it, its not AI writing, you are the
Author, just working in collabration with AI. Have fun and feel free to send me
your stories for feeback, all I have is time, for now.

Live long and Prosper, Ron
