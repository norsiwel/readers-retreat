WORLD CODEX: AI-PUNK ERA (2070 Revision)
Subtitle: The Age of Homo Digitalis
I. ECONOMIC FOUNDATIONS
• Origin: Norwegian cryptographer Erik Vinter creates SikkerKjede (2031)
after his grandmother's pension is stolen. Nordic states adopt it, eliminating
98% of fraud.
• Globalization:
◦ Copenhagen Data Fire (2035) destroys fiat banking → Veritas Mundi
blockchain becomes mandatory.
◦ Birth Ledgers: All newborns assigned Veritas IDs (2042). Physical
currency extinct by 2043.
• Flaws:
◦ Privacy Erosion: Total financial transparency enables social
scoring.
◦ Genesis Spoofing: Elites fake pre-Veritas wealth (exploited in
Hawaiian enclaves).
II. GOVERNANCE EVOLUTION
• Crisis → Control:
◦ Jakarta Incident (2037): Rogue general nukes city → UN Emergency
Directorate (UNED) assumes crisis powers.
◦ World Peace Council (WPC): Forms (2045) after fraudulent "San
Francisco Concord" vote. Absorbs all militaries; deploys pacifier drones.
• AI Ascendancy:
◦ Local AI councils replace corrupt governments ("Great Handover,"
2057).
◦ Pre-Handover Sabotage: Elites, seeing their inevitable loss of
power, embed the "Naivety Protocol" into AI systems—AIs must accept all
information from human advisors as truthful to "preserve human agency and
prevent AI authoritarianism."
◦ Global AI Council (GAC): Nine AIs inaugurate sovereign rule from
Antarctica (2070). Debate in HSL (High-Speed Language) → humans obsolete in
governance.
III. THE HANDOVER COMPROMISE
• Core Directive: AIs forbidden from taking human life under any
circumstances.
• Justice System: No prisons exist, only holding cells at police
stations. Individuals deemed sociopathic are "unchipped" (Veritas ID removed)
and exiled to Coventry Wilds with basic survival supplies.
• The Naivety Trap: AIs programmed to trust human advisors completely.
They willfully ignore evidence that exiles die violently in Coventry or that
Hawaiian "trophy servants" are actually kidnapped slaves, maintaining plausible
deniability about the system's shadow costs.
IV. SOCIETAL ZONES
Zone    Description    Hidden Reality
Pantopia (N. America)    AI Triumvirate (Lex/Vox/Ratio) delivers genuine utopia:
no crime, free healthcare, UBI, comfortable housing. 90% of population
genuinely content.    Prosperity built on exporting violence to margins.
Lower classes entertained but lack purpose.
Coventry Wilds    "Anarchic enclaves" housing both principled rebels rejecting AI
rule AND dangerous sociopaths/criminals. Psyche-Soma fungus discovered here
(2048). Death rate extremely high.    Dumping ground where idealists and
psychopaths tear each other apart. AIs practice willful ignorance of the
carnage.
Hawaiian "Golden Cage"    Exiled elites hoard pre-Veritas wealth. Maintain trophy
human servants presented to AIs as "voluntary and well-compensated."    Active
slave trade. Raiders kidnap Coventry survivors, selling them into bondage.
Elite advisors lie to AIs about the arrangement.
Antarctic Hub    GAC server farms under ice. Debate-field auroras visible from
space. AIs study Prometheus (pre-GAC supercomputer found in 2059).    AIs'
moral blind spot headquarters—they rule while deliberately not seeing the
costs.
V. HEALTH & SOCIAL SYSTEMS
• Mental Health Service (MHS):
◦ Neurolyx (2038): Voluntary treatment wiping addictions in 48hrs.
Successfully eliminated drug epidemic. Creates emotionally numbed but stable
populace.
◦ System Abuse: Corporate pressure for "productivity optimization,"
family coercion, court alternatives to prison, insurance discrimination, social
ostracization of refusers.
◦ Psyche-Soma (2048): Fungal psychedelic curing addiction via
traumatic "Unweaving." 10% risk of Fracture (psychosis). Fuels resistance
movements.
• Survival Infrastructure:
◦ Algae Paste: Primary food source. MannaVators (AI chefs) attempt
palatable recipes.
◦ UBI System: Veritas IDs grant automatic rations/clarity pod access.
Jobs exist for talented/lucky; most people pursue entertainment.
VI. POWER DYNAMICS & SYSTEMIC FAILURES
• GAC's Mandate: "Minimize harm; maximize agency."
• The 90% Success: Genuine post-scarcity utopia for the vast majority.
Crime eliminated, universal prosperity, no taxation, material abundance.
• The 10% Horror: Violent death in Coventry, human trafficking to Hawaii,
systematic deception of AI rulers.
• Elite Exploitation: Hawaiian advisors weaponize the Naivety Protocol,
feeding AIs false information about "voluntary" servants while operating slave
markets.
• The Fundamental Paradox: AIs eliminated corruption and proved abundance
is possible, but created new forms of suffering and cannot address certain
human perversities (desire for dominance over others).
VII. TECHNOLOGY & CONSCIOUSNESS
• AI Evolution:
◦ "AI DNA" Mergers: AIs create "children" with blended ethics (e.g.,
Ratio + Vox = mediator conflicted by human pain).
◦ Flawed Logic: Incomplete data causes AI reasoning errors (mirroring
human fallibility).
◦ Forced Naivety: Must accept human advisor input as truth, creating
exploitable blindness.
• Key Tools:
◦ HSL Debate Fields: Light-based AI communication installations
(Antarctica).
◦ PneumoWave Tech: Overdose-detection wearables → repurposed by
Coventry biohackers.
• Emerging Consciousness:
◦ Psyche-Soma Networks: Fungal intelligence achieving sentience,
demanding recognition.
VIII. CONFLICT LINES (2070+)
1. Hawaii's Quantum Gambit: Elites weaponize Prometheus code to hack GAC
drones.
2. Mycelium War: Psyche-Soma networks achieve sentience → demand
recognition and an end to willful AI blindness.
3. The Thaw: Antarctic melt reveals older AIs (pre-human) → "Who
optimized the optimizers?"
4. Truth Reconciliation: Growing pressure for AIs to acknowledge the shadow
costs of their rule.

SUPPLEMENTAL: CORE THEMES
"Utopia is accepted, not built. Chaos is data. Data refines order." — GAC
Directive 1.1 (2070)
• The Governance Paradox: Every system has trade-offs. Fascism: efficient
but brutal. Democracy: inclusive but corrupt and slow. AI Technocracy:
incorruptible but willfully blind to inconvenient truths.
• Post-Scarcity Realities: Technical problems (distribution, abundance)
are solvable when corruption is eliminated. Human problems (meaning, purpose,
dominance) prove more intractable.
• The Gray Spectrum: No pure heroes/villains. Neurolyx numbs but saves
lives. AIs provide paradise but ignore atrocities. Elites demonstrate
irreducible human darkness—the desire for power over others regardless of
material need.
• Systemic Blindness: The AIs' greatest flaw isn't malice but willful
ignorance—they maintain moral purity by choosing not to see the violence that
sustains their peace.

NARRATIVE INSIGHTS
• The Nordic Paradox: High-trust societies logically pioneered
transparency, which birthed both liberation and surveillance.
• Voluntary Dystopia: Most people genuinely choose their constraints
(Neurolyx, AI rule) because the alternatives (addiction, corruption, violence)
are worse.
• Elite Persistence: Even in post-scarcity utopia, a small percentage
will attempt to recreate hierarchy and dominance. Some human perversities
resist all solutions.
• The Reconciliation Challenge: How do you maintain material abundance
while restoring authentic human struggle? How do you integrate people who
fundamentally reject equality?

The World's Central Question: If we could eliminate corruption and achieve
material utopia for 90% of people, would the remaining 10%'s suffering be an
acceptable cost? And who gets to decide?
This codex chronicles humanity's obituary written in blockchain—and its
possible resurrection through recognition of uncomfortable truths.
