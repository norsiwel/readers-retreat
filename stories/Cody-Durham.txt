Cody Durham gazed out of the viewport in the cramped apartment he had
called home for as long as he could remember. The city of Neotropolis on Prime,
a bustling metropolis on the planet in the Betelgeuse system, stretched out
beneath him. Neon lights painted the skyline in vibrant hues, reflecting off
the chrome surfaces of the towering skyscrapers.
Ever since he was a child, Cody had dreamt of exploring the stars. He grew up
on stories of interstellar adventures and alien encounters, fueling his desire
to leave the confines of Prime. The dusty docks, where colossal starships
arrived and departed, were a constant reminder of the life he longed for.
After 15 long years of toiling as a dockworker, Cody had saved enough money to
make his dreams come true. The hard work, the sweat, and the countless hours
spent loading and unloading cargo had finally paid off. With a pocketful of
credits and a heart full of determination, he set out to obtain his first
starship.
The first step was obtaining a pilot's license. Cody enrolled in a rigorous
training program, spending sleepless nights studying navigation, astrophysics,
and the intricacies of piloting a spacecraft. His determination was unyielding,
fueled by the vision of breaking free from the gravitational pull of Prime.
Finally, the day arrived when Cody earned his pilot's license. With the
certificate in hand and a newfound sense of purpose, he headed to the bank to
secure the financing for his very own starship. The interstellar bank, nestled
within the heart of Neotropolis, was a bustling hub of financial transactions
for aspiring spacefarers.
As Cody stepped into the bank, he couldn't help but feel a surge of excitement
mixed with trepidation. The sleek, robotic bank teller greeted him with a
metallic voice, "Welcome to Galaxy Finance. How may I assist you today?"
"I'm Cody Durham, and I'm here to finance my first starship," he declared,
trying to conceal his nervousness.
The robotic teller processed his request efficiently, scanning his
identification and credit history. After a brief pause, it conveyed,
"Congratulations, Mr. Durham. You are eligible for a starship loan. Please
follow me to the financing department."
Cody followed the robotic guide through the labyrinthine corridors of the bank
until they reached the financing department. A human loan officer greeted him,
a rare sight in a world dominated by automation.
"Mr. Durham, I understand you're looking to finance a starship.
Congratulations on reaching this milestone. Let's discuss the terms and options
available to you," the loan officer said, gesturing for Cody to take a seat.
After a thorough discussion and a meticulous review of the financing terms,
Cody signed the contract. The weight of the pen in his hand felt like a key
unlocking the door to his dreams.
With the financing secured, Cody Durham stepped out of the bank, a mix of
excitement and anticipation coursing through his veins. The neon lights of
Neotropolis seemed to shine even brighter, as if celebrating his impending
departure.
The journey ahead was uncertain, but Cody Durham was ready to embrace the
unknown. He had his pilot's license, a financed starship, and a burning desire
to explore the cosmos. As he walked back to his apartment to prepare for the
adventure that awaited him, he couldn't help but feel the gravitational pull of
destiny guiding him towards the stars.
