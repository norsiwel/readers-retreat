Baker’s Choice

The golden light of dusk spilled over Maple Hollow like honey poured from
heaven’s own jar, gilding the cobblestone streets and the tiny bakery perched
at the edge of town. Its sign creaked in the wind—“Sylvie’s
Sweetness”—and inside, Sylvie herself wiped flour from her apron, humming a
tune she’d forgotten long ago. The shop smelled of vanilla and nostalgia,
with sugar-dusted counters and shelves crammed with jars labeled  Starlight
Syrup  and  Wishful Whipped Cream . It was her sanctuary, though lately even
the cinnamon seemed to whisper secrets.  “Another batch of lavender
scones?” asked her assistant, a lanky teen named Finn, poking his head
through the kitchen door. His hair stuck up in wild tufts, defying gravity and
Sylvie’s constant requests for “some semblance of order.”  She blinked,
distracted. Something prickled at the edge of her senses—a familiar scent,
but sharper than usual, like the lavender had been kissed by lightning. Her
eyes flicked to the back wall, where a faded tapestry hung askew, its threads
frayed into whispers.  The one that never comes loose , she thought, though in
truth it always did if you tugged just right…  A crash sounded upstairs—the
apartment’s old clock tower, chiming not six but  seven  times. Sylvie froze.
The clock hadn’t worked in thirty years. Finn gaped at the stairs. “Did we
miss a holiday or something?”  “No,” she muttered, stepping into the
shadow beneath the tapestry. Her fingers brushed the fabric, and it dissolved
like mist. Beneath lay not brick but bark, alive with glowing moss. A
door—no,  a tree trunk —opened inward, revealing roots that spiraled
downward into darkness.  “What’s back there?” Finn breathed, following
her gaze.  “Don’t.” Sylvie closed the tapestry, but it rippled like water
now, and a voice hummed through the walls:  “The door is always open when
time remembers its name.”   That night, Sylvie found herself in a forest
older than towns, where trees glowed like green fire. A figure stood before
her—a woman with bark-like skin and hair of ivy tendrils. “Sylvie,” she
said, voice echoing leaves, “you’ve let the door stay closed too long.”
“Who  are  you?” Sylvie’s hands trembled, clutching a rolling pin from
some pocket dimension.  “I am Lirael, guardian of thresholds. Your bakery was
once a bridge between worlds… until your great-grandmother sealed it ‘for
safety.’ Now time itself is unraveling here. The seasons bleed into one
another. Mortals dream in reverse.” She gestured to the forest floor, where
flowers bloomed and withered in seconds. “Fix it—or this world drowns in
chaos.”  “So I bake a cake? A charm?” Sylvie tried for bravado but
failed.  “Not so simple.” Lirael’s fingers brushed Sylvie’s cheek;
saplings sprang from the touch. “You must create something that holds both
endings and beginnings—a  Loopbloom Tart . But its ingredients are…
elusive. You’ll need moonlight stolen from a crescent’s edge, a single
laugh from someone who hasn’t smiled in years, and…” She hesitated.
“…the last drop of rain from a storm that never happened.”  Finn appeared
at her side the next morning, determined to help. (“I’ve seen Stranger
Things,” he said defensively.) They spent days chasing phantom ingredients:
sneaking past Mr. Grimsby (grumpiest man in Maple Hollow) to capture his
accidental chuckle after slipping on a banana peel; climbing the clock tower at
midnight with buckets to catch moonlight, which dripped like liquid silver; and
finally cornering an ancient librarian who’d hoarded her last raindrop in a
teacup since 1942.  But as Sylvie assembled the tart in Lirael’s forest
kitchen—spelled spoons stirring counterspells—the spirit grew quieter. Her
bark cracked, revealing veins of smoke. “The loop is breaking faster than we
thought.”  When Sylvie placed the tart into an oven forged from starlight and
roots, Lirael gripped her arm. “Your great-grandmother severed this link to
save  you —her descendant—from the wars between realms. To fix it… you
might have to choose.”
The tart burst into flames upon baking—not destructive ones, but petals that
unfurled into a thousand blossoms. The forest gasped. Seasons flickered across
branches like film reels: spring’s green, summer’s gold, autumn’s rust,
winter’s white—all at once, then settling properly.  Lirael smiled,
dissolving into mist. “Thank you, Sylvie.” Her voice lingered in the wind.
“The bridge stays open… but so does your heart.”  Back home, the
bakery’s tapestry hung neatly again—but Finn swore he saw it shift
sometimes when no one looked. And on quiet nights, customers claimed to taste
something wild and ancient in the scones—a hint of forest and forgotten time.
Sylvie never spoke of it. But she kept the teacup with its last phantom
raindrop on her windowsill. Some doors, she decided, shouldn’t be closed
entirely… just carefully balanced between magic and mundane. And if Maple
Hollow’s clock now chimed twice at dawn? Well, who was counting?  The
end—or perhaps just another bite of tart.
