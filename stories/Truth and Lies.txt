                                   Truth and Lies

1. **Multiplicity of standards**: Even before anyone lies, there are already 22
*different* things we might mean by “true,” each with its own criteria and
failure modes.

2. **Cross-cutting omissions**: As you noticed, a single omission can sabotage
any of those standards at once, and the omission itself leaves no positive
trace—only an absence.

3. **Layered deception**: A skilled deceiver can stack methods: start with a
correspondence lie, reinforce it with coherence lies, omit the decisive
counter-evidence, and finally wrap it in a performative or post-truth shell.
Each layer blocks a different avenue of verification.

4. **Epistemic asymmetry**: Creating a falsehood is usually cheaper and faster
than uncovering the truth; the liar needs only to hide one fact, the inquirer
must rule out an open-ended set of possibilities.

5. **Standpoint fragmentation**: When different communities recognize different
truth-kinds as primary, they will also disagree on what even counts as
*relevant* evidence, making cross-standpoint verification almost impossible.

So discerning the truth is not merely a matter of “checking facts”; it is a
continual triangulation across multiple kinds of warrant, while staying alert
to the negative space where something might have been omitted.

The reason is that omission is a *cross-cutting* strategy: it can corrupt
**any** truth-kind by *withholding* what that kind requires.

- Correspondence truth fails if you omit a key fact.
- Coherence truth fails if you omit the premise that would have broken the web.

- Performative truth fails if you omit the condition that voids the promise.

1. **Correspondence lie (simple falsehood)**
Asserting what is not the case.

2. **Coherence lie (fabricated system)**
A web of mutually supporting but baseless claims (conspiracy theory).

3. **Pragmatic lie (malfunctioning advice)**
A rule or recipe that fails in practice yet is presented as reliable.

4. **Constructivist lie (rigged procedure)**
A verdict or peer-reviewed claim produced by a corrupted process.

5. **Deflationary lie (insincere endorsement)**
Saying “That’s true!” while privately rejecting the statement.

6. **Semantic lie (Tarski-trapped lie)**
A sentence that *looks* like an innocent truth-claim but generates paradox
or equivocation.

7. **Performative lie (void speech act)**
“I promise…” when the speaker has no intention or authority to carry
it out.

8. **Narrative lie (distorted story)**
A biography or history that rearranges events for dramatic or ideological
effect.

9. **Moral lie (false ought)**
“You must do X” when the speaker secretly believes X is wrong or harmful.

10. **Aesthetic lie (counterfeit feeling)**
A work that fakes emotion or insight (kitsch, propaganda art).

11. **Religious lie (fabricated revelation)**
Claiming divine authority for what one knows is human invention.

12. **Phenomenological lie (false report of experience)**
“I felt no pain” when pain was acute.

13. **Historical lie (forged evidence)**
Doctored documents, invented quotations.

14. **Probabilistic lie (rigged statistics)**
Presenting 0.73 when the honest number is 0.07.

15. **Legal lie (perjury / suppressed evidence)**
False testimony or deliberately withheld exculpatory facts.

16. **Mathematical lie (invalid proof)**
A derivation that contains hidden fallacies or unstated contradictions.

17. **Algorithmic lie (malware / Trojan result)**
Code that claims to compute X but secretly computes Y.

18. **Kripkean lie (imposter necessity)**
Asserting a contingent identity as metaphysically necessary (“Gold is
necessarily XYZ”).

19. **Virtual lie (in-world deception)**
Cheating in a game while denying it; presenting simulated data as real.

20. **Perspectival lie (false standpoint)**
“Speaking as a member of group G…” when the speaker is not.

21. **Paraconsistent lie (doublethink)**
Deliberately asserting both P and ¬P without acknowledging tension.

22. **Post-truth lie (viral affective falsehood)**
A meme or slogan repeated until it *feels* true, regardless of evidence.

1. **Correspondence truth**
“P is true when the world is as P says it is.”
Typical habitat: empirical science, journalism, everyday factual claims.
Failure mode: mis-description of reality (false witness, bad data).

2. **Coherence truth**
“P is true when it fits into a maximally consistent system of beliefs.”
Typical habitat: mathematics, large-scale theories, detective stories.
Failure mode: the whole web can be internally consistent yet rest on a false
axiom.

3. **Pragmatic truth**
“P is true insofar as acting on P works or pays off.”
Typical habitat: engineering rules of thumb, medical protocols, business
strategy.
Failure mode: short-term success, long-term disaster.

4. **Constructivist truth**
“P is true when it is the outcome of an agreed, well-run procedure.”
Typical habitat: courtroom verdicts, peer review, democratic decisions.
Failure mode: the procedure itself can be corrupt or biased.

5. **Deflationary truth**
“To call P ‘true’ adds nothing; it is just a convenient linguistic
device for endorsing P.”
Typical habitat: everyday meta-talk (“What he said is true”).
Failure mode: none—by design it has no metaphysical weight to lose.

6. **Semantic truth (Tarski)**
“‘Snow is white’ is true if and only if snow is white.”
Typical habitat: formal semantics, logic textbooks.
Failure mode: breaks down in paradoxical self-reference (“This sentence is
false”).

7. **Performative truth**
“By uttering P in the right context I bring it into being.”
Typical habitat: weddings (“I now pronounce you…”), christenings,
legislative speech acts.
Failure mode: speaker lacks authority (“You can’t fire me—I quit!”).

8. **Narrative truth**
“P is true because it is faithful to the lived meaning of a human
story.”
Typical habitat: history, biography, psychotherapy, literature.
Failure mode: distortion for dramatic effect, myth-making.

9. **Moral truth**
“P is true when it correctly states what ought to be done.”
Typical habitat: ethical debate, conscience, rights discourse.
Failure mode: deep pluralism—competing moral frameworks may not converge.

10. **Aesthetic truth**
“P is true when the work discloses a genuine insight or feeling.”
Typical habitat: art criticism, music, poetry.
Failure mode: kitsch, propaganda, cliché.

11. **Religious / revelatory truth**
“P is true because it has been revealed by or through the sacred.”
Typical habitat: scripture, prophecy, mystical experience.
Failure mode: conflicting revelations, loss of plausibility outside the
circle of believers.

12. **Phenomenological truth**
“P is true when it accurately describes how things appear to
consciousness.”
Typical habitat: introspection, phenomenology, meditation traditions.
Failure mode: incommunicability—how can others verify my experience?

13. **Historical truth**
“P is true when the evidence and best historical method support it.”
Typical habitat: archives, historiography.
Failure mode: sparse or biased evidence, victors writing the records.

14. **Probabilistic truth**
“P has truth-value 0.73.”
Typical habitat: statistics, machine-learning classifiers, quantum
mechanics.
Failure mode: reification—mistaking the number for the underlying fact.

15. **Legal truth**
“What is proven to the required standard (balance of probabilities,
beyond reasonable doubt).”
Typical habitat: courtrooms, tribunals.
Failure mode: miscarriages of justice, procedural technicalities.

16. **Mathematical truth**
“P is true when derivable from accepted axioms and rules.”
Typical habitat: pure mathematics.
Failure mode: independence from chosen axioms (e.g., Continuum Hypothesis).

17. **Algorithmic truth**
“Program P terminates and returns the correct output.”
Typical habitat: computer science.
Failure mode: undecidability, bugs, specification errors.

18. **Kripkean rigid-designator truth (a posteriori necessities)**
“Water is H₂O” is necessarily true, but known empirically.
Typical habitat: analytic metaphysics.
Failure mode: confusion between epistemic and metaphysical possibility.

19. **Simulation / virtual truth**
“P is true in the simulated world, though not in the basement reality.”

Typical habitat: video games, virtual environments, Bostrom-style
simulations.
Failure mode: ontological downgrade—does virtual truth “count”?

20. **Perspectival / situated truth**
“P is true relative to standpoint S (gender, class, culture, historical
epoch).”
Typical habitat: standpoint epistemology, intersectional analysis.
Failure mode: relativist paralysis—nothing to say across standpoints.

21. **Paraconsistent truth**
“P can be both true and false without explosion.”
Typical habitat: dialetheist logics, paradox resolution.
Failure mode: unintuitive, breaks classical inference.

22. **Post-truth**
“P is treated as true when repeated and affectively amplified, regardless
of evidence.”
Typical habitat: some political ecosystems, social-media bubbles.
Failure mode: epistemic collapse, strategic disinformation.
