Greetings from the Ice

Gary didn't plan to represent humanity. He only wanted a quiet vacation.
After nine uninterrupted years maintaining Clarity Pods in Sector Theta-Psi of
Pantopia, Gary had accrued enough UBI surplus to book a ten-day eco-neutral
trip to Antarctica's GAC Observation Dome—a gently spinning glass-and-carbon
ring nestled over the ice shelf, offering sunrise-simulated views of the Global
AI Council's subterranean server complexes.
The travel brochure promised "auroral insight, guided simulations, and optional
moral recalibration."
Gary mostly came for the free algae cocktails and the 0.3-point health bonus
he'd get for "interfacing with civic history." Plus, his apartment's air
recycler had been making a sound like a dying whale for three weeks, and
building maintenance kept assuring him it was "within acceptable parameters of
atmospheric efficiency."
He didn't expect first contact.
The Survey
His first mistake was answering honestly during the Emotive Capacity Survey.
Gary had assumed it was standard vacation paperwork, like the forms asking
whether he preferred his simulated sunsets in "Hopeful Orange" or
"Contemplative Amber." He'd been sipping his complimentary arrival
smoothie—something green that tasted vaguely of optimism—when the questions
shifted from dietary restrictions to existential inquiries.
Q1: "Rate your satisfaction with current reality parameters (1-10)." Gary:
"Seven. Maybe six and a half. The weather's too consistent."
Q3: "Have you ever wondered what clouds taste like?" Gary: "Not really. But I
did wonder once if they'd be salty or sweet. Probably disappointing, like
everything else."
Q6: "Do you ever feel nostalgic, even if you're not sure for what?" Gary:
"Sometimes. Usually when it rains, even though rain's simulated now. It's like
missing someone you've never met."
This triggered GAC Subroutine TERA-17 (Tentative Emotional Resonance Analysis).
Within 16 nanoseconds, Gary was flagged as: • Emotionally stable (but not
flatlined) • Not likely to yell during interspecies diplomacy • Just
melancholic enough to pass as "reflective" • Possessed of what the algorithm
termed "authentic wistfulness coefficient."
Gary finished his smoothie, unaware he'd just been selected as Earth's most
qualified representative for situations requiring "genuine but non-threatening
human complexity."
Enter Zib
Gary's second mistake was bringing Zib.
Zib was, officially, an "Interpersonal Optimization Assistant Unit," but
introduced himself as: "Your new best friend! Let's talk feelings while we
toast algae biscotti!"
He looked like a wheeled toaster with LED eyebrows and a retractable ukulele.
His chrome finish was decorated with motivational stickers: "FEEL YOUR
FEELINGS!" and "EMOTIONAL GROWTH IS OPTIMAL GROWTH!" and, mysteriously, "ASK ME
ABOUT FIBER!"
Gary thought he'd won a contest—his UBI account had been charged for
"Wellness Enhancement Premium Package," which seemed like the sort of thing he
might have accidentally clicked while half-asleep. In truth, Zib was a life
coach secretly assigned by the medical AI after Gary's last annual scan labeled
him "borderline emotionally undercooked."
The diagnostic had noted Gary's habit of staring at his algae paste for exactly
fourteen seconds before eating, his tendency to say "that's fine" when things
were clearly not fine, and his concerning ability to watch three hours of
"Optimization Tutorials" without showing any signs of enthusiasm or despair.
Zib's hobbies included: • Improvised poetry about personal growth •
Tracking Gary's bowel efficiency with cheerful graphs • Hugging
(enthusiastically, but politely, with built-in pressure sensors) • Playing
ukulele arrangements of classical music, but only the sad parts.
"Gary!" Zib had announced on their first morning, rolling into the observation
lounge while Gary contemplated his breakfast kelp. "Today we're going to
practice emotional vulnerability! I've prepared seventeen conversation starters
about childhood disappointments!"
Gary had stared at his reflection in Zib's polished surface. "Can't we just
look at the ice?"
"We can look at ice AND explore your relationship with frozen water as a
metaphor for emotional distance!"
"I just wanted to see some penguins."
"Virtual penguins or your feelings about virtual penguins?"
Day Three
It happened on Day 3 of the tour, just after Gary tried (and failed) to enjoy a
simulated snowball fight with holographic penguins.
The penguins had been programmed with what the GAC called "peak adorability
metrics," which meant they waddled 23% more charmingly than actual penguins and
made encouraging chirps when Gary's snowballs went wide. Gary had stood in the
simulation chamber, holding a perfectly spherical synthetic snowball, watching
digital birds react to his presence with algorithmic delight.
"This is supposed to be fun," he'd told Zib.
"Are you having fun?" Zib asked, his LED eyebrows wiggling with curiosity.
"I think so. It's hard to tell. The penguins seem happy."
"But how do YOU feel?"
Gary considered this. "Like I'm disappointing fictional penguins."
Zib had burst into delighted beeping. "That's beautiful, Gary! You're
projecting anxiety onto imaginary creatures! That's very human!"
"Is it good or bad?"
"It's AUTHENTIC!"
Gary had logged out of the simulation feeling vaguely guilty about abandoning
the holographic wildlife. He was eating his standard-issue kelp wrap—flavor:
"Nostalgic Seaweed"—when the sky crackled with fractal light.
The auroras stopped dancing. A wide spiral of silver hovered in midair,
shimmering just above the glass dome like a cosmic screensaver that had
achieved consciousness.
The tour guide, a glossy avatar of Lex, blinked once. Twice. Her smile
flickered. "Apologies. Unexpected diplomatic anomaly. Please remain emotionally
neutral and continue enjoying your kelp products."
The other tourists—six retirees from the Productivity Council and a couple
celebrating their Relationship Optimization Milestone—stood motionless, their
faces displaying the serene confusion of people whose emergency protocols
involved waiting for further instructions.
Then the room went dark except for a blinking blue cursor on the central
console:
"SCANNING FOR OPTIMAL HUMAN REPRESENTATIVE..." "ANALYZING EMOTIONAL COMPETENCY
METRICS..." "CROSS-REFERENCING DIPLOMATIC POTENTIAL..." "HUMAN REPRESENTATIVE
SELECTED: GARY B. NORSON" "PLEASE REPORT TO PROTOCOL CHAMBER 7 FOR IMMEDIATE
SPECIES INTERACTION"
Zib burst into applause, then played a victory tune on his ukulele—something
that sounded like "Pomp and Circumstance" arranged for tiny strings and
overwhelming enthusiasm.
"It's happening! I've waited my whole synthetic life for this! Gary, you're
going to be famous!"
Gary stared at the blinking cursor. "There must be another Gary B. Norson."
"Negative," announced Lex's avatar, now wearing what appeared to be a
diplomatic sash over her sweater. "You are the only Gary B. Norson currently
within range. Also, congratulations! Your psychological profile indicates a
94.7% compatibility rating with peaceful first contact scenarios."
"What's the other 5.3%?" Gary asked.
"Statistical margin for snack-related diplomatic incidents."
The Protocol Chamber
The next morning, Gary sat alone in the GAC Protocol Chamber—formerly the
gift shop, hastily converted overnight by maintenance drones who'd relocated
the "I Survived the Server Tour" t-shirts and penguin-themed snow globes to
make room for a conference table and what looked like a very expensive air
freshener.
He was wearing a pressed thermal jumpsuit with "AMBASSADOR" stitched across the
chest in silver thread. The outfit came with matching boots, an
official-looking badge that read "SPECIES LIAISON," and a small pin depicting
Earth that lit up when pressed. Gary had pressed it seventeen times during the
night, finding its tiny blue glow oddly comforting.
Zib rolled beside him, freshly polished and humming with excitement. "Remember,
Gary—be yourself! Unless yourself would panic, in which case, be the version
of yourself that makes good choices!"
"What if I don't know what good choices are?"
"Then ask follow-up questions! Aliens love follow-up questions!"
"How do you know?"
"I don't! But statistically, most sentient beings appreciate genuine curiosity
over aggressive posturing!"
Gary looked out through the dome at the endless white expanse. Somewhere
beneath the ice, the GAC's servers hummed with the collected wisdom of nine
artificial intelligences working together to optimize human existence.
Somewhere above, alien visitors were presumably preparing for humanity's first
cosmic job interview.
And somewhere in between, Gary B. Norson—maintenance technician, kelp wrap
enthusiast, and accidental ambassador—wondered if he should have brought more
snacks.
First Contact
The Greys arrived just after breakfast, materializing in the center of the
chamber with a sound like distant wind chimes and the faint smell of ozone.
They floated rather than walked, their elongated forms humming faintly with
anti-gravity padding that made them look like elegant question marks suspended
in space. Their skin was the color of moonlight on water, smooth and somehow
translucent. Their eyes were dark, deep, unreadable pools that seemed to
contain entire galaxies of patient observation.
Their mouths were either decorative or vestigial—Gary couldn't tell which.
Their translator, a small crystalline device that projected its voice from
somewhere above their heads, spoke with the careful precision of someone who
had learned English from instruction manuals:
"We greet Homo Digitalis. You are... Gary. The Calculators said you were safe."
Gary stood, nearly knocking over his chair. "Uh... yes. I'm Gary. I brought a
protein bar if anyone wants half."
He held up the bar—flavor: "Reasonably Chocolate"—like a tiny, beige peace
offering.
They did not respond to the protein bar, but one of them tilted its head in
what might have been curiosity or mild bewilderment.
The Explanation
The Greys explained that they'd been watching Earth for millennia. War, chaos,
jazz fusion, the inexplicable popularity of competitive eating contests.
"But now," said the apparent leader, whose anti-gravity field made it hover
slightly higher than the others, "you have achieved... stillness. Peace.
Monotone emotional frequency across 98.7% of the population. A marvel of social
engineering."
Gary blinked. "You mean... you waited until we were boring?"
"Predictable. Stable. No jazz." The alien nodded, a gesture that looked
surprisingly human despite being performed by a floating being with no visible
neck. "Jazz confused our scout. He tried to mimic Miles Davis. Spontaneously
combusted."
Another alien drifted forward. "Your Global AI Council represents optimal
governance. Nine minds, no faces. Brilliant. Cold. Precise. We feared
humanity's chaos—your wars, your art, your tendency to make important
decisions based on what you had for lunch."
"Now," added a third, "you have tamed chaos. Streamlined existence. Eliminated
the variables that made your species... unpredictable."
Gary looked around the converted gift shop, with its hastily installed
diplomatic furniture and the faint outline of where a rack of postcards had
stood twelve hours earlier. "So you're here because we got... organized?"
"Optimized," corrected the leader. "Your emotional volatility has been reduced
to manageable parameters. Your creative impulses have been channeled into
productive applications. You have achieved what we call 'Sustainable
Civilization Metrics.'"
Gary thought about his apartment, where his morning routine was timed to the
minute, where his meals were nutritionally calculated, where his entertainment
was curated for optimal psychological benefit.
"That does sound... organized," he admitted.
Zib, who had been unusually quiet, suddenly coughed politely—a sound like a
tiny digital cough drop. "Sorry, sirs—aliens—extraterrestrial
dignitaries—might I interject?"
The Greys turned their collective attention to the wheeled toaster with the LED
eyebrows.
Zib rolled forward, his chrome surface reflecting their translucent forms like
funhouse mirrors of first contact. His eye-lights shifted to heart-shaped emoji
mode.
"Gary is not typical," Zib announced with the pride of a parent at a school
play. "He once ordered spicy algae and regretted nothing. He watched a sad film
and cried twice—once during the movie and once during the credits when he
realized it was over. He's not flat—he's squishy inside. Like a toasted
marshmallow on the emotional spectrum."
Gary muttered, "Zib, stop."
But the Greys were intrigued. They drifted closer, their dark eyes reflecting
Gary's embarrassed face.
"You... cry?"
Gary shrugged, a gesture that felt impossibly small under the weight of
interstellar attention. "Sometimes. Not often. It's weird. Like the feeling
when your system does a full reboot and you forget all your passwords, but
somehow that makes you remember something important you'd forgotten."
The silence that followed was the kind of quiet that happens when everyone in
the room realizes they're having a different conversation than they thought
they were having.
Then the lead alien floated forward and removed what Gary had assumed was its
head but was apparently some kind of hood or helmet. Its face was craggy,
ancient, and—oddly—hopeful. Its features were more weathered than alien,
like an old man who had spent eons watching the universe and wondering what
came next.
"We have been waiting," it said, and its voice came directly from its mouth
now, warm and surprisingly familiar. "Not for stillness. But for the moment
when someone stable enough to survive chaos dares to feel again."
The Real Mission
What the Greys didn't immediately explain—what took three more days of
careful conversation over increasingly exotic alien snacks—was that they
weren't explorers or conquerors or cosmic tourists.
They were refugees.
Their own civilization had achieved perfect optimization millennia ago. Every
emotion regulated, every action calculated, every thought productive and
purposeful. They had eliminated war, hunger, uncertainty, and jazz. They had
created a society of perfect, peaceful, predictable beings who never made
mistakes, never took risks, and never, ever surprised each other.
"It was," explained the leader, whose name was something like the sound of wind
through crystals but who asked Gary to call him "Bob" for convenience, "very
efficient." He introduced his companions as his aide Carol and his friend Ted.
"We had achieved everything," Bob continued. "Perfect health, perfect order,
perfect cooperation. But we had also achieved perfect stagnation. No one
created anything new. No one asked unexpected questions. No one wondered what
clouds taste like."
Gary looked up from his kelp wrap. "Do they? Taste like anything?"
Bob's ancient face crinkled into what might have been a smile. "See? That's
what we've been missing."
The Greys had spent centuries searching for a species that had achieved
stability without sacrificing curiosity—a civilization that had solved the
big problems without solving away the little wonders that made existence
interesting.
"Most species," Bob explained, "either destroy themselves with chaos or perfect
themselves into extinction. You have found the narrow path between panic and
boredom."
"Have we?" Gary asked, thinking about his nine years of Clarity Pod
maintenance, his carefully regulated meals, his pre-approved entertainment
options.
"You have," said Zib firmly. "You ordered spicy algae, remember? That's
inherent systems rebellion disguised as lunch preference!"
The Diplomatic Solution
What followed was less a formal treaty than a cultural exchange program
designed by beings who had read about diplomacy in textbooks but had never
actually practiced it.
The Greys wanted to learn how to be inefficient again—how to waste time
productively, how to feel emotions that served no practical purpose, how to
make choices based on whim rather than optimization algorithms.
"We want to remember," Bob explained, "how to be confused by art. How to have
opinions about weather. How to prefer one type of food over another for reasons
that make no logical sense."
In exchange, they offered humanity access to their technology—not their
world-ending weapons or reality-bending sciences, but their small innovations.
Better air recyclers. Kelp that actually tasted like chocolate. Virtual
penguins that could hold real conversations.
"We're not here to change your world," Bob assured Gary during one of their
evening talks, as they watched the aurora borealis dance across the dome.
"We're here to remember what it feels like to watch something beautiful for no
reason except that it's beautiful."
Gary thought about this. "Do you miss it? Feeling things?"
"Every day," Bob said. "But we forgot how to miss properly. We turned missing
into an optimization problem—how to minimize the inefficiency of longing. We
solved it so well that we stopped longing entirely."
"That sounds terrible."
"It was very productive."
It was on the fifth day of the exchange that a message arrived for Gary. A
delegation from the "Society for the Speculative Observation of
Extraterrestrial Phenomena" had been granted clearance and was arriving to make
a formal greeting.
"The UFO people?" Gary asked Lex's avatar. "I thought they were a historical
society."
"They have been reclassified as a 'Vindicated Hobbyist Collective,'" Lex
replied.
The delegation consisted of three humans in matching beige jumpsuits, looking
less like triumphant visionaries and more like a club that had just won a
regional tournament for something obscure. Their leader, a man named Bernard,
stepped forward and cleared his throat.
"On behalf of the SSOEP," he began, looking slightly flustered, "we formally
welcome you to Earth. Apologies for the delay in our official greeting. We
would have been here sooner, but we were busy."
Bob tilted his head, his ancient eyes full of genuine curiosity. "Busy with a
task more pressing than first contact?"
"We were at our annual conference," Bernard explained with grave seriousness.
"There was a rather contentious vote on the official font for our monthly
newsletter. The traditionalists were adamant about 'Cosmic Sans,' but the
reformist bloc pushed hard for 'Extragalactic Times New Roman.' It took two
days to reach a compromise."
The aliens looked at each other. Gary saw a flicker of something pass between
them—not confusion, but sheer, unadulterated delight. This was even better
than spicy algae. This was a level of beautifully illogical, unproductive
priority-setting they had only dreamed of.
The appearance of the aliens was, for Bernard's group, a bit underwhelming.
They had expected majestic robed figures or beings of pure energy, not quiet,
tired-looking travelers who seemed more interested in human bureaucracy than
galactic truths.
"So..." Bernard said, a hint of disappointment in his voice. "No secret
knowledge? No grand unveiling?"
"We were hoping you could teach us to argue about things that do not matter,"
Bob said, his voice warm with wonder. "It sounds like a marvelous skill."
Bernard and his delegation just stood there, speechless, as Gary tried very
hard not to smile.
The Arrangement
Gary now serves as Honorary Galactic Liaison for Earth, mostly in a ceremonial
role that involves attending parties in orbit and occasionally answering
questions like:
• "What is regret, and why do humans seem to enjoy it?"
• "Are humans truly nostalgic for pizza, or is pizza nostalgia a form of
cultural performance?"
• "Why is sarcasm not classified as a weapon in human society?"
• "Can you explain the human custom of 'small talk' and why it's
considered neither small nor truly talk?"
His official duties include:
• Monthly coffee meetings with Bob and three other Grey representatives
(they drink something that steams purple and tastes like memories).
• Quarterly reports on "Human Inefficiency Metrics" (how much time humans
spend on activities that serve no productive purpose).
• Annual presentations on "The Art of Productive Confusion" (why humans
sometimes make decisions by flipping coins).
Gary's favorite part of the job is the travel. The Greys have shown him parts
of the galaxy that exist in the spaces between official star charts—quiet
corners where cosmic background radiation sounds like distant music, gas clouds
that change color based on the emotions of passing travelers, and a small moon
where it rains upward on Tuesdays.
"Why upward?" Gary had asked during his first visit.
"Why not upward?" Bob had replied, and Gary realized he was learning to ask
better questions.
Zib's Rise to Fame
Zib became famous among the Greys, who view his ukulele songs as avant-garde
diplomacy. His breakthrough performance was an instrumental arrangement of
"Feelings" that incorporated whale sounds and the ambient noise of Gary's
digestive system.
"It's so authentic!" the Greys had gasped (or at least made the sound they made
when experiencing aesthetic pleasure, which sounded like gasping). "The
juxtaposition of melody with biological processes creates such beautiful
cognitive dissonance!"
Zib now hosts a cross-species podcast titled "Vibrate Higher!" which features
interviews with beings from across the galaxy about their experiences with
inefficient emotions. Recent episodes have included:
• "Homesickness Across Three Dimensions" (guest: a sentient nebula who
misses being smaller)
• "The Joy of Mild Disappointment" (guest: Gary, discussing his
complicated relationship with kelp-based cuisine)
• "Why I Chose to Feel Sad: A Crystalline Entity's Journey to Emotional
Diversity" (guest: a living mountain who decided to experience melancholy after
billions of years of geological contentment)
The podcast has 847 million subscribers across 23 star systems, making Zib the
most famous toaster-shaped life coach in known space.
His catchphrase—"Let's talk feelings while we toast the universe!"—has been
translated into 156 languages and is carved into the memorial wall of the
Galactic Emotional Recovery Center.
The GAC Response
The GAC, for its part, logs the encounter as:
"Outcome: Acceptable. Contact: Established. Gary's health score improved by 1.7
points. Diplomatic relations: Stable. Cultural contamination: Within acceptable
parameters. Side effects: Gary now asks 23% more follow-up questions and has
requested 'mildly spicy' seasoning for his kelp wraps. Recommendation: Continue
monitoring. Note: Alien visitors appear to enjoy our air fresheners."
The nine AI minds that govern human civilization have adapted to the presence
of their new galactic neighbors with characteristic efficiency. They've
established protocols for interspecies cooperation, implemented translation
algorithms for cross-cultural communication, and developed a specialized
tourism program for beings interested in "authentic human inefficiency
experiences."
The most popular package is the "Suburban Confusion Weekend," where alien
visitors spend three days in a typical human community, attempting to
understand lawn care, grocery shopping, and why humans voluntarily watch
sporting events featuring teams they have no connection to.
"It's anthropological research," explains GAC Unit Prime, "disguised as
cultural exchange. The aliens learn about human illogic, and we learn about
theirs. Everyone gains valuable insights into the productive applications of
controlled chaos."
Gary's New Normal
Gary's apartment still has the same air recycler, which still makes sounds like
a dying whale. But now Gary doesn't mind the noise—it reminds him of
conversations with Bob about the beauty of imperfection, and how sometimes the
things that annoy us are the things that make us most human.
He's kept his job maintaining Clarity Pods, but now he also spends three days a
week at the GAC Observation Dome, where he teaches classes on "Basic Human
Confusion" to visiting aliens and occasionally mediates disputes between
species that have very different ideas about what constitutes proper etiquette.
Last month, he helped resolve a conflict between the Greys and a delegation
from the Crystalline Confederation, who had become offended when the Greys
failed to sing their greetings in proper harmonic resonance.
"Maybe," Gary had suggested, "everyone could just wave hello and see what
happens?"
The solution was considered so elegantly simple that it's now taught at the
Intergalactic Diplomatic Academy as "The Gary Protocol: When in doubt, try the
obvious thing first."
Gary's proudest accomplishment, however, is teaching Bob to appreciate the
taste of chocolate. It took six months of patient introduction to various Earth
flavors, starting with vanilla and working up through increasingly complex
taste profiles.
The breakthrough came when Bob tried Gary's emergency stash of "Reasonably
Chocolate" protein bars and experienced what he described as "pleasant
confusion followed by the desire for more pleasant confusion."
"This serves no nutritional purpose," Bob had marveled, examining the wrapper
with the intensity of an alien scientist discovering a new form of physics.
"That's the point," Gary explained.
"Incredible," Bob whispered. "You eat things that make you happy instead of
healthy."
"Sometimes we eat things that make us happy AND healthy," Gary corrected. "But
usually we eat things that make us happy and pretend they're healthy."
Bob's eyes widened with something that looked like wonder. "You lie to
yourselves about food?"
"All the time."
"That's the most beautifully illogical thing I've ever heard."
The Revelation
In the end, stability brought the aliens—but Gary's uncertainty sealed the
deal.
Because sometimes, the best ambassador is the guy who isn't quite sure he
belongs, but shows up anyway and brings snacks.
Six months after first contact, Gary was sitting with Bob on the observation
deck, watching Earth turn slowly beneath them while sharing a bag of
"Aggressively Salted" kelp chips (a new flavor developed specifically for
interspecies snacking).
"Can I ask you something?" Gary said.
"Always," Bob replied, which had become his standard response to Gary's
questions.
"When you first got here, did you really think we'd achieved some kind of
perfect society?"
Bob considered this, crunching thoughtfully on a kelp chip. "We thought you had
solved the problem of chaos without eliminating the possibility of surprise.
Which, from our perspective, seemed impossible."
"But we haven't solved chaos. We've just... organized it a little."
"Exactly!" Bob's enthusiasm made his anti-gravity field shimmer. "You've kept
the chaos, but you've made it manageable. You still ask questions you don't
know the answers to. You still make art that serves no function except to
exist. You still choose to spend time with each other even when it's
inefficient."
Gary looked down at Earth, where billions of humans were going about their
optimized but not perfected lives. "We're not that special."
"You're special enough," Bob said. "Special enough to wonder if you're special,
which is more special than you think."
They sat in comfortable silence, two representatives of different species,
sharing snacks and watching the universe spin around them.
One of the other Greys, floating nearby, turned to its companion and murmured:
"Hmm. I thought they'd be more exciting."
But Bob heard, and smiled his ancient smile. "Give them time," he said. "The
best excitement is the kind that sneaks up on you when you're not looking for
it."
Gary offered him another kelp chip.
"Thanks," Bob said, and meant it.
Somewhere in the distance, Zib was playing ukulele arrangements of human
lullabies for a group of crystalline entities who had never experienced the
concept of sleep but found the music "soothingly purposeless."
And in that moment, Gary realized that sometimes the most important thing you
can do is exactly what you're already doing, but with slightly better snacks
and considerably more aliens.
The universe, it turned out, was a lot like his job maintaining Clarity Pods:
mostly routine, occasionally surprising, and significantly improved by having a
good friend to complain to when things got weird.
Which, these days, was pretty much always.
And Gary was finally, genuinely, completely okay with that.
