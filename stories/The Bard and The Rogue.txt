                                                      The Bard and the Rogue
The air in the Salty Siren tavern hung thick and low, a noxious tapestry
woven from stale ale, cheap pipeweed, questionable stew, and the unwashed
bodies of its patrons. It was the kind of place where fortunes were lost on the
turn of a card, reputations were shattered with a drunken word, and pockets
were lightened with alarming regularity. It was precisely this last feature
that had drawn Faelar Shadowgleam to its grimy embrace. He moved through the
throng like smoke, a whisper in worn leather, his silver hair catching the
flickering lamplight only when he allowed it. His grey eyes, sharp and
discerning, scanned the room, dismissing the common drunks and dockhands,
settling finally on a portly merchant near the hearth, whose velvet coat and
jingling coin purse screamed ‘easy mark’. Faelar needed passage north, and
Master Geldon Swineheart looked poised to fund the journey. He eased closer, a
shadow detaching itself from other shadows, his fingers already anticipating
the satisfying weight of the purse. He was inches away, the subtle click of the
clasp the only sound he focused on, when the world exploded in noise.
“Ode to the Orc King’s Boil!” a voice boomed, shattering the relative
quiet. A dwarf, stout as a weathered oak stump, leaped onto a tabletop, nearly
upsetting a flagon of something purple. He brandished a lute that looked almost
as sturdy as he did, its wood scarred and stained but clearly well-loved. A
magnificent brown beard, intricately braided and glinting with silver rings,
cascaded down his chest. “Ahem! Gather ‘round, ye miserable bilge rats, and
lend yer ears to Borin Stonebeard, teller of tales, singer of songs, and
connoisseur of fine—well, any—ale!” He struck a chord, a surprisingly
resonant sound that vibrated through the floorboards and rattled Faelar’s
teeth. The elf froze, his hand hovering mere centimeters from the merchant’s
purse. Swineheart, startled, clapped a hand protectively over his valuables.
Faelar shot a venomous glare at the dwarf, who seemed utterly oblivious,
launching into a bawdy verse involving a goblin, a barmaid, and a highly
improbable vegetable. The crowd roared, some with laughter, some with drunken
indignation. Tankards slammed, feet stomped, and in the ensuing chaos, a burly
stevedore lurched sideways, knocking Borin’s outstretched arm. The dwarf
stumbled, his flagon of purple liquid arced through the air, and drenched
Faelar from shoulder to hip. The cold, sticky shock of it was momentarily
paralyzing. The merchant, seeing the drenched, menacing elf suddenly appear
beside him, yelped, “Thief! Guards! My purse!”
Faelar swore under his breath, a sibilant hiss lost in the dwarven ballad’s
crescendo. The game was up. Two burly figures wearing the stained tabards of
the town watch began shouldering their way through the crowd. Borin, mid-verse
about the barmaid’s revenge, finally noticed the commotion centering around
the damp elf he’d accidentally showered. “Oy! Beg pardon, Master Elf!” he
bellowed, hopping off the table. “Bit of a spill! No harm intended, just
adding a bit of… dramatic splash?” He beamed, entirely missing the
murderous intent in Faelar’s eyes. The guards were getting closer. Faelar
needed a diversion, now. He glanced around, calculating escape routes. Borin,
perhaps sensing the elf’s desperation or simply feeling a dwarven sense of
responsibility for the chaos he’d initiated, suddenly grinned. “Right then!
Seems my pointy-eared friend needs a bit of… accelerated departure! Allow
me!” He swung his lute high and struck a chord of such shattering dissonance
that glass vibrated, several patrons clutched their heads, and one of the
advancing guards tripped over a stray dog that had been sleeping peacefully
until that moment. “RUN!” Borin roared, punctuating it with another jarring
twang. Faelar didn’t need telling twice. He darted towards the back exit,
moving with a speed that defied the crowd. He heard heavy footfalls behind him
and risked a glance back. The dwarf, surprisingly nimble for his bulk, was
right behind him, lute clutched like a weapon. They burst out into a narrow,
refuse-strewn alley, the shouts of the guards fading behind them. Faelar kept
running, deeper into the warren of shadowed passages that made up the town’s
backside. The dwarf huffed and puffed but somehow kept pace. Finally, in a
dead-end alley choked with overflowing bins, Faelar stopped, turning to face
his unwelcome companion.
“Are you insane?” Faelar hissed, wiping futilely at the sticky purple stain
on his tunic. “Of all the idiotic, loud-mouthed, clumsy—!”
“Saved yer pointy ears, didn’t I?” Borin interrupted, leaning against a
damp wall to catch his breath. He grinned, unabashed. “Borin Stonebeard, at
yer service! Though usually my performances end with applause, not pursuit.”
He offered a calloused hand. Faelar stared at it as if it were a venomous snake.
“You ruined a delicate operation,” Faelar said, ignoring the hand. “And
got me soaked in whatever foul brew that was.”
“Blackberry wine,” Borin said cheerfully. “Imported! Though I suspect the
‘importing’ involved a leaky barrel and a fast horse. Still, could be
worse. Could’ve been troll grog. Stains and smells. Permanently.” He
finally lowered his hand, his grin faltering slightly at the elf’s icy
demeanor. “Look, Master Elf…”
“Faelar.” The name was clipped, reluctant.
“Faelar! Right. Look, Faelar, things got a bit… exuberant. My apologies for
the drenching and the, ah, unwanted attention. But we’re out of it now, eh?
No harm truly done.”
“No harm?” Faelar gestured at his ruined tunic, then back in the direction
of the tavern. “I lost my mark, attracted the watch, and am now stuck in a
filthy alley with a dwarf who thinks shattering eardrums qualifies as
subtlety.”
Borin bristled slightly. “Now hold on! That ‘shattering eardrum’ trick
got us clear, didn’t it? And who are you calling clumsy? You were the one
lurking about like a guilty shadow!”
“It’s called stealth,” Faelar retorted. “A concept likely as foreign to
your people as bathing.”
Borin’s beard practically bristled. “Oh, is that how it is? Well, at least
we dwarves don’t spend all day preening and whispering secrets to trees! We
build things! We sing! We live!”
“You bellow,” Faelar corrected. “There’s a significant difference.”
They glared at each other, the ancient animosity between elf and dwarf
crackling in the narrow space. Before the argument could escalate further, a
dry cough echoed from the alley entrance. They both spun around, Faelar
instinctively reaching for the daggers hidden beneath his cloak, Borin hefting
his lute defensively. Standing there was a stout, grey-haired woman wiping her
hands on a stained apron. It was Griselda, the owner of the Salty Siren, her
expression a mixture of amusement and exasperation.
“Having a nice chat, are we?” she asked, her voice raspy. “Heard the
commotion. Figured it might be you two. That chord, Master Dwarf? Nearly took
the shingles off my roof.”
Borin flushed slightly. “Apologies, Mistress Griselda. Artistic fervor, you
understand.”
“I understand you cost me two guards’ worth of free ale and scared off my
best-paying customer, Swineheart,” she said flatly. “And you, elf, sticky
fingers rarely pay the bills in the long run.” Faelar remained silent, his
face an unreadable mask. Griselda sighed. “Look, you’re both in a bind. The
watch is looking for a drenched elf and a noisy dwarf. You need to lay low,
maybe even leave town for a bit.” She paused, eyeing them speculatively.
“And it just so happens, I might have a little job for a pair with… unique
talents.”
Faelar narrowed his eyes. “We are not a pair.”
“Not yet,” Griselda said with a knowing smirk. “But you might be. Old
Master Elmsworth, the recluse mage up on Whisper Hill, had something stolen. A
rather unique lute. Sentimental value, he says, though I suspect there’s more
to it. He’s offering a fair bit of coin for its return. Enough to cover your
damages here, get you new tunics, and see you well clear of Cliffside.”
Borin’s eyes lit up. “A lute? Stolen? A quest! By my beard, that sounds
like the start of a fine ballad! ‘The Ballad of the Pilfered Plectrum’!”
Faelar groaned inwardly. “A mage’s stolen trinket? Why us?”
“Because,” Griselda said, leaning closer, her voice dropping, “the
suspected thieves are a band of goblins holed up in the Whispering Woods. Needs
muscle, maybe a bit of noise to scare ‘em, but also someone who can sneak in
and out without getting turned into goblin stew. Seems to me,” she looked
from Borin’s sturdy frame to Faelar’s shadowed form, “you two might
actually complement each other. If you don’t kill each other first.” She
shrugged. “Take it or leave it. But if you stay, the watch will find you.”
Faelar considered. He needed to get out of Cliffside anyway. Goblins were
unpleasant but manageable. And the coin would be useful. The dwarf, however…
He glanced at Borin, who was already humming a tune, likely composing the
aforementioned ballad. It was absurd. But Griselda was right; they were stuck.
“Fine,” Faelar said, the word tasting like ash. “We’ll retrieve the
mage’s lute.”
Borin beamed. “Excellent! An adventure! Faelar and Borin, on the trail of the
missing music! This calls for a song!”
“No,” Faelar said firmly. “It calls for leaving. Now. Before you attract
any more attention.” He turned and melted into the deeper shadows at the end
of the alley, not waiting to see if the dwarf followed. He heard the heavy
tread behind him, accompanied by a low, irrepressible humming. Faelar sighed.
This was going to be a very long journey.
The Whispering Woods lived up to its name, though not in the way Faelar
might have preferred. It wasn’t the gentle rustle of leaves or the soft
murmur of hidden streams that dominated, but the incessant, low-pitched humming
emanating from the dwarf trudging determinedly beside him.
“Must you?” Faelar finally snapped, after an hour of the monotonous sound.
They were following a barely-there path, sunlight dappling through the thick
canopy overhead.
Borin looked up, surprised. “Must I what? Keep spirits up? Ward off gloom?
Practice my scales?”
“Hum,” Faelar clarified through gritted teeth. “We are attempting to
approach a goblin encampment undetected. Constant noise is…
counterproductive.”
“Bah! A bit of humming never hurt anyone,” Borin scoffed. “Besides, it
keeps the rhythm for walking. Steady pace, see? Good for covering ground.” He
stamped his feet slightly harder, emphasizing the beat. Faelar closed his eyes
for a moment, praying for patience. Elven patience was legendary, but Borin
Stonebeard tested its limits with every step, every hum, every cheerful
observation about moss varieties or the potential edibility of fungi.
Their journey to Master Elmsworth’s tower on Whisper Hill had been brief and
surprisingly cordial, largely because the old mage was partially deaf and
communicated primarily through written notes. He’d confirmed Griselda’s
offer, provided a rough map to the suspected goblin hideout – a cluster of
caves near the Gloomfang Ravine – and described the stolen lute: ebony wood
inlaid with mother-of-pearl, strung with silver, supposedly crafted by a moon
elf luthier centuries ago. He’d seemed more agitated than sentimental, Faelar
noted, his eyes darting nervously as he handed over the advance payment.
Now, deep in the woods, their enforced partnership grated. Faelar moved with
the silence of a falling leaf, his senses alert to every snapped twig, every
distant bird call. Borin moved like… well, like a dwarf: solid, deliberate,
and about as stealthy as a rockslide. He commented on the quality of the stone
underfoot, pointed out interesting geological formations, and occasionally
broke into fragments of song when the mood struck him.
“These woods aren’t so bad,” Borin declared, swatting at a low-hanging
branch. “Good sturdy oaks. Reminds me a bit of the foothills near Ironhelm,
though fewer goats.”
“They are goblin-infested woods,” Faelar reminded him dryly. “Try to
maintain some semblance of caution.”
“Caution’s my middle name!” Borin boomed, then clapped a hand over his
mouth. “Well, not really. It’s Grumstone. Borin Grumstone Stonebeard.
Doesn’t have the same ring, does it? Caution doesn’t scan well in
ballads.”
Faelar pinched the bridge of his nose. “Just… be quiet. Please.”
They pressed on, Faelar taking point, his eyes scanning the path ahead, his
ears straining for any sound beyond Borin’s shuffling footsteps. He found
tracks soon enough – crude, splayed footprints, broken branches, discarded
scraps of mouldy leather. Goblins, no doubt about it. He signaled Borin to
halt, crouching low to examine the signs.
“Camp’s close,” Faelar whispered, pointing towards a dense thicket.
“Cave entrance likely beyond that.”
Borin nodded, his usual boisterousness replaced by a more serious expression.
He hefted his own trusty lute. “Right. What’s the plan, sharp ears?”
Faelar considered. A frontal assault was out; goblins relied on numbers and
nasty traps. “I’ll scout the entrance, assess their numbers and layout. You
stay here, keep watch. And stay quiet.”
“Quiet as a stone,” Borin promised, settling himself behind a large,
moss-covered boulder. Faelar gave him a dubious look but nodded, then melted
into the undergrowth. He moved circuitously, circling the thicket, his senses
on high alert. He found the cave mouth easily enough – a dark gash in the
hillside, partially obscured by thorny bushes. A crude wooden palisade,
haphazardly constructed, guarded the entrance, and the acrid smell of goblin
cook-fires drifted on the air. He could hear their guttural chatter from
within. Peering carefully from behind a tree, he counted at least a dozen
goblins milling about just inside the entrance, armed with crude spears and
rusty cleavers. Deeper within, he could hear more. Getting the lute wouldn't be
simple. He needed a distraction. A significant one. He crept back towards
Borin’s position, his mind racing.
He found the dwarf exactly where he’d left him, peering intently towards the
cave. “Well?” Borin whispered eagerly.
“At least a dozen near the entrance, more inside,” Faelar reported.
“Poorly fortified, but too many for a direct approach. I need to get inside,
locate the lute, and get out. I need a diversion.”
Borin’s eyes gleamed. “A diversion? My specialty!”
“Not *that* kind of diversion,” Faelar said quickly, picturing shattered
eardrums and collapsing cave roofs. “Something loud enough to draw most of
them away from the main chamber, but not so chaotic it brings the whole warren
down on us.”
Borin stroked his beard thoughtfully. “Hmm. Loud, but controlled… How
about a rousing rendition of ‘The Grumpy Badger’s Wedding Feast’? Always
gets a reaction. Confuses ‘em, too. They start arguing about whether the
badger actually married the stoat.”
Faelar stared at him. “You want to sing… to goblins?”
“Not just sing! Perform! Distract! Annoy! Trust me, pointy ears, my music
has its uses beyond taverns.” He slung his lute forward. “Give me a signal
when you’re ready. I’ll draw them towards the ravine edge, east of the
entrance. Should give you a few minutes.”
Faelar hesitated. Relying on the dwarf’s loud, unpredictable nature went
against every instinct he possessed. But what choice did he have? “Fine. When
you hear a whistle – like this.” He produced a soft, two-toned bird call.
“Start your… performance. Keep them occupied, but don’t get yourself
killed.”
Borin grinned. “Don’t you worry about old Borin! Might even get some new
material out of it. ‘The Goblin Audience’, perhaps?”
Faelar just shook his head and slipped back towards the cave entrance, finding
a concealed position where he could observe. He waited, breathing evenly,
calming his nerves. This was his element – the shadows, the anticipation, the
silent infiltration. He watched the goblins squabble over a roasted rat, their
attention focused inwards. Taking a deep breath, he gave the signal, the clear
bird call cutting through the forest sounds.
For a moment, nothing happened. Then, from the direction of the ravine, came a
sound unlike anything Faelar had ever heard. It started with a booming chord,
followed by Borin’s voice, amplified by the natural acoustics of the woods,
bellowing: “GATHER ‘ROUND, YE FILTHY GROTS! HAVE YE HEARD THE TALE SO
GRAND…?”
The goblins near the cave mouth froze, their beady eyes wide with confusion.
They muttered to each other, pointing towards the sound. Borin launched into
the promised song, a nonsensical, raucous tune with a driving beat. Several
goblins, drawn by the noise and the sheer audacity of it, began shuffling
towards the ravine, brandishing their weapons. More emerged from deeper within
the cave, curious and agitated. Soon, only two remained near the entrance,
peering uncertainly into the darkness.
It was Faelar’s chance. He darted from his cover, silent as a wraith. He
dispatched the first goblin with a precise strike to the back of the neck,
catching the creature before it could fall noisily. The second turned at the
faint sound, but Faelar was already there, his dagger finding its mark. He
dragged the bodies quickly into the bushes and slipped inside the cave.
The main chamber was larger than he’d expected, dimly lit by sputtering
torches. Piles of refuse, stolen goods, and crude bedding littered the floor.
The stench was overpowering. Most of the goblins were gone, drawn out by
Borin’s bizarre concert. Only a handful remained, including a particularly
large, brutish-looking goblin wearing a necklace of teeth, presumably the
chief. And there, leaning carelessly against a pile of mildewed sacks, was the
lute – ebony wood, mother-of-pearl inlay, unmistakable.
Faelar hugged the shadows, moving along the cave wall. The chief was arguing
with another goblin, distracted. Faelar needed to be quick. He slid past a pile
of bones, his eyes fixed on the lute. He was almost there when a small goblin,
previously hidden behind a rock, squealed and pointed directly at him.
The chief whirled, bellowing in alarm. Faelar cursed and lunged, snatching the
ebony lute just as the chief charged, swinging a massive, notched club. Faelar
dodged, using the lute itself to parry a clumsy blow – a sacrilege, perhaps,
but necessary. He needed to escape, but the chief and the remaining goblins
blocked the entrance. Outside, Borin’s song reached a crescendo, punctuated
by goblin shrieks and what sounded suspiciously like a lute chord being used as
a percussive weapon.
Think fast. Faelar spotted a narrow fissure in the back of the cave, barely
wide enough for him to squeeze through. He feinted towards the entrance,
drawing the chief’s attack, then pivoted and sprinted for the fissure,
clutching the precious lute. The chief roared in frustration and hurled his
club; it smashed against the rock wall just as Faelar slipped into the tight
passage. He wriggled through the claustrophobic darkness, scraping against
stone, the lute held carefully in front of him. He could hear the goblins
scrabbling behind him, unable to follow easily. After what felt like an
eternity, he saw a faint light ahead and emerged, breathless and dusty, onto a
narrow ledge halfway down the Gloomfang Ravine.
Below him, a truly chaotic scene unfolded. Borin stood on a precarious
outcrop, lute in hand, surrounded by a mob of furious goblins. He wasn't just
singing anymore; he was dodging spears, occasionally whacking a goblin over the
head with his sturdy instrument (much to Faelar’s horror), and punctuating
his dodges with defiant, booming chords. He looked ridiculous, exhilarating,
and terrifyingly dwarven. Several goblins lay groaning on the ground, victims
of either the music or the lute itself.
“Oi! Faelar!” Borin yelled, spotting him on the ledge. “Got the shiny
wood? About time! My audience is getting a bit restless!” A spear whizzed
past his head.
Faelar quickly scanned the situation. Borin was trapped. More goblins were
scrambling down the ravine sides. He looked at the lute in his hands – Master
Elmsworth’s prize. Then he looked down at the dwarf who, despite his bluster
and noise, had created the diversion that allowed him to succeed. He made a
decision.
“Borin! Catch!” Faelar yelled. Holding the delicate ebony lute carefully,
he judged the distance and tossed it down towards the dwarf. Borin’s eyes
widened, but his hands shot out, catching the instrument deftly even as he
sidestepped another goblin’s lunge.
“Are ye mad?” Borin bellowed, cradling the rescued lute protectively while
fending off a goblin with his own. “This thing’s priceless!”
“Less priceless than your thick skull!” Faelar retorted. He quickly
unslung the coil of thin, strong rope he always carried. Securing one end to a
sturdy root, he tossed the other down towards the dwarf. “Grab hold! I’ll
pull you up!”
Borin didn’t hesitate. Stuffing the ebony lute hastily into his tunic, he
grabbed the rope just as the goblins surged forward. Faelar braced himself,
pulling with all his strength. The dwarf, surprisingly light on his feet when
motivated, scrambled up the rock face, aided by the rope and Faelar’s steady
pull. He collapsed onto the ledge beside the elf, panting heavily, just as the
first goblins reached the bottom of the rope, shaking their fists and
screeching curses.
“Well,” Borin gasped, pulling the ebony lute from his tunic and inspecting
it for damage. “That… was invigorating! Did you see that move where I used
the dominant seventh chord to distract the big one? Classic!”
Faelar ignored him, quickly cutting the rope near the root. “We need to
move. They’ll find another way up.” He glanced at the lute Borin was
fussing over. It seemed unharmed, miraculously.
As Borin carefully polished a smudge off the mother-of-pearl inlay with his
sleeve, his fingers brushed against one of the decorative swirls. “Hmm,” he
murmured, frowning. “That’s odd. This bit feels… loose.”
Faelar leaned closer. Indeed, one small piece of the intricate inlay near the
base of the lute seemed slightly raised. His curiosity piqued, Faelar gently
probed it with a fingernail. It shifted. With his delicate touch, honed by
years of picking locks and disarming traps, he carefully worked at the edge of
the inlay. It wasn’t just loose; it was hinged. With a soft click, a tiny
section of the ebony wood popped open, revealing a hidden compartment no bigger
than his thumb.
Borin gasped. “By my ancestors’ beards! A secret compartment!”
Inside, nestled on a bed of faded velvet, lay a small, tightly rolled piece of
parchment, yellowed with age and tied with a frayed silken cord. Faelar
carefully extracted it. His fingers trembled slightly as he unrolled the
fragile document. It wasn't blank. Drawn in faded ink were complex lines,
symbols, and annotations. It was a map. Or rather, a fragment of one. One
section clearly depicted jagged mountain peaks marked with dwarven runes Faelar
couldn’t read, pointing towards what looked like a stylized mine entrance.
Another section showed a winding river leading to a slender, elegant spire,
unmistakably elven in design, surrounded by symbols he vaguely recognized from
ancient lore. The two sections didn't quite meet, torn jaggedly across the
middle.
“Well, I’ll be…” Borin breathed, peering over Faelar’s shoulder.
“That’s no ordinary lute maker’s mark. Those runes… they point the way
to Khazad-Dum’s sister mine, Zirak-Morbênd! Lost for centuries!” His eyes
then traveled to the other side of the map fragment. “And that tower… it
looks like something from the Elder Days of your people, elf.”
Faelar stared at the map, his mind reeling. This wasn't just a sentimental
keepsake. Master Elmsworth hadn't just wanted his lute back; he'd wanted this
map fragment. The goblins hadn't stolen it for its value as an instrument;
they'd likely just grabbed it along with other loot, unaware of its secret. But
who had it before the goblins? And why was Elmsworth so nervous?
“This changes things,” Faelar said softly, his voice tight. “This is why
Elmsworth wanted it back so badly. He wasn’t just a recluse mage…”
“He was after a treasure map!” Borin finished, his eyes wide with
excitement. “Hidden in a fancy lute! It’s brilliant! It’s… it’s the
stuff of legends! ‘The Ballad of the Secret Map and the Musical Dwarf’!”
“Focus, Borin,” Faelar urged, carefully rolling the map fragment back up.
“Someone else knew about this. Someone who potentially lost it, allowing the
goblins to find it. Elmsworth might not be the only one interested in this.”
He tucked the parchment securely inside his own tunic. “We need to get back
to Whisper Hill, but we need to be careful. We might have more than just
goblins to worry about now.” He looked at Borin, seeing not just a loud
dwarf, but the unlikely ally who had braved a goblin horde and caught a
priceless artifact tossed down a ravine. A grudging respect began to bloom in
the elf’s cautious heart. “Let’s go. And try,” he added, unable to
resist, “to be quiet this time.”
Borin grinned, slinging his own battered lute over his shoulder and carefully
securing the ebony one. “Quiet as a mouse plotting world domination, pointy
ears. Lead on!” They scrambled off the ledge, leaving the screeching goblins
behind, the mystery of the map fragment hanging heavy and exciting between
them. The journey back through the Whispering Woods was markedly different.
Borin, perhaps sensing the shift in stakes or Faelar’s newfound seriousness,
actually made an effort at stealth, his humming reduced to a barely audible
murmur, his footsteps surprisingly light on the forest floor. Faelar found
himself glancing back not with annoyance, but almost with reassurance.

They approached Whisper Hill cautiously as dusk painted the sky in shades of
violet and bruised orange. Master Elmsworth’s tower stood stark against the
fading light, a solitary finger of stone pointing at the heavens. No lights
shone from its narrow windows.
“Doesn’t seem right,” Borin murmured, squinting at the dark structure.
“Even recluses light a candle, don’t they? Unless he’s meditating in the
dark? Or counting his gold by feel?”
“Or he has company,” Faelar said grimly. He held up a hand, signaling
Borin to halt behind a cluster of gnarled hawthorn bushes. “I’ll approach
the tower. Wait for my signal. If I’m not back in fifteen minutes, or if you
hear significant trouble…”
“I come charging in, lute blazing?” Borin suggested hopefully.
“No,” Faelar said firmly. “You take the map fragment,” he patted his
tunic, “and the lute, and you get away from here. Find someone trustworthy
– if such a person exists – and tell them what happened. This map could be
important.”
Borin’s cheerful expression faded. He looked from Faelar to the tower, then
back again, gripping his own lute tightly. “Understood, Faelar. But… be
careful in there. Don’t go getting yourself skewered before I finish
composing our ballad.” There was genuine concern in his voice, a stark
contrast to their earlier antagonism.
Faelar gave a curt nod, a gesture that felt inadequate for the sentiment. He
slipped from the bushes, merging seamlessly with the deepening shadows that
pooled around the tower’s base. He circled the structure, his senses alert.
No guards, no obvious traps. The main door, a heavy oak affair banded with
iron, was slightly ajar. That was careless. Or deliberate. Faelar drew one of
his daggers, the polished steel gleaming faintly. He pushed the door open a
fraction wider, peering into the Stygian darkness within. A faint scuffling
sound drifted from upstairs, followed by a muffled curse. Someone was
definitely inside.
He slipped through the doorway, silent as drifting snow. The ground floor was
a circular room, cluttered with bookshelves, arcane paraphernalia, and
overturned furniture. A struggle had clearly taken place. Faelar moved towards
the spiral staircase that dominated the center of the room, his steps making no
sound on the dusty stone flags. He ascended slowly, listening intently.
“…told you he’d hire someone!” a sharp voice hissed from the upper
level. “Now they’ll have the lute, and the map fragment!”
“Calm down, Silas,” another voice replied, deeper and rougher. “We dealt
with the old fool. He didn’t talk. If his hired help shows up, we deal with
them too. Then we find this lute, get the map, and we’re set for life.”
Faelar reached the top of the stairs, peering around the edge. He was in
Elmsworth’s study. The mage lay slumped in his high-backed chair near a large
window, unnaturally still. Faelar suspected he wouldn't be lighting any more
candles. Two figures stood over him. One was a tall, thin man in dark,
practical clothing – Silas, presumably. The other was a burly mercenary type
with a shaved head and a cruel sneer. They were searching the mage’s robes.
“Nothing here,” the mercenary grunted, tossing aside a pouch that clinked
emptily. “Where would the old goat hide a map?”
“In the lute, you dolt!” Silas snapped. “That’s why we need it! I told
Master Elmsworth I knew his secret when I was his apprentice, told him I
deserved a share. He refused, the greedy old fool. Tried to hide it better,
even arranged the ‘goblin theft’ himself to throw me off the scent while he
planned to retrieve it later! But I was watching.”
So, Elmsworth had orchestrated the goblin ‘theft’. And his former
apprentice had come calling. Faelar assessed the situation. Two opponents, one
likely skilled in some form of magic (given his apprenticeship), the other pure
muscle. He needed to act quickly, decisively. He glanced back down the stairs.
Where was Borin? Probably vibrating with impatience. Faelar formulated a
desperate plan, banking on the one asset he now possessed: a loud,
unpredictable dwarf.
He took a steadying breath and stepped boldly into the room. “Looking for
this?” he asked coolly, holding up the ebony lute he’d retrieved from Borin
just before scouting. Both men spun around, startled. Silas’s eyes widened in
recognition, then narrowed in fury. The mercenary grinned, cracking his
knuckles.
“Well, well,” the mercenary growled. “Look what the cat dragged in. Hand
over the lute, elf, and maybe we’ll let you walk out of here.”
“I think not,” Faelar said, backing slowly towards the open window that
overlooked the steep drop on the tower’s far side. “This artifact seems
rather valuable.”
“You have no idea,” Silas hissed, his hands beginning to glow with faint
arcane energy. “Give it to me!”
As Silas lunged, chanting an incantation, Faelar did the last thing they
expected. He hurled the priceless ebony lute out the window. It tumbled through
the air, end over end, towards the rocks far below. Silas screamed in rage, his
concentration broken. The mercenary gaped, momentarily stunned by the sheer
audacity.
That was the moment Faelar had been waiting for. He ducked under the
mercenary’s wild swing and drove his dagger into the man’s side. The
mercenary roared, stumbling back. Simultaneously, a tremendous CRASH echoed
from downstairs, followed by Borin’s unmistakable battle cry: “FOR ALE,
ADVENTURE, AND POINTY-EARED ALLIES!” Heavy footsteps thundered up the spiral
stairs.
Silas, recovering his wits, ignored the wounded mercenary and turned his fury
on Faelar. He unleashed a bolt of crackling energy; Faelar dove behind an
overturned table as the bolt splintered the wood where he’d been standing.
The mercenary, clutching his side, staggered towards Faelar, murder in his eyes.
Just then, Borin burst into the room, his own battered lute held like a
shield, his face red with exertion and battle-lust. He took in the scene –
Faelar pinned behind the table, the wounded mercenary advancing, Silas
gathering energy for another spell, the still form of Elmsworth, the open
window.
“Right!” Borin bellowed. He didn’t charge. Instead, he planted his feet
firmly, raised his lute, and struck a chord of such pure, resonant power that
the very air seemed to hum. It wasn’t dissonant like his goblin-scattering
trick; this was different. It was a chord of courage, of defiance, of dwarven
resilience. The mercenary faltered, clutching his head. Silas winced, the
arcane energy around his hands flickering.
Faelar seized the opening. He kicked the table over, sending it crashing into
the mercenary’s legs. The big man howled and fell. Faelar sprang forward, not
towards Silas, but towards the window. He risked a glance down. There, nestled
miraculously in the branches of a resilient, wind-blown pine tree growing from
the cliff face about twenty feet below, was the ebony lute, apparently unharmed.
“The lute’s safe!” Faelar yelled to Borin.
Silas shrieked in frustration and fired another bolt, this one aimed at the
dwarf. Borin met it head-on, not with magic, but with music. He struck another
powerful chord, a wall of sound that seemed to momentarily deflect the arcane
energy, sending sparks scattering harmlessly.
“Impressive!” Faelar called out, genuinely surprised. He used the moment
to close the distance with Silas, dagger leading. The apprentice, his magic
momentarily disrupted, drew a wicked-looking curved knife. They circled each
other, Silas’s desperation making him reckless, Faelar’s precision keeping
him just out of reach.
Borin, meanwhile, dealt with the mercenary. Seeing the big man struggling to
rise, Borin didn’t hesitate. He swung his sturdy lute in a wide arc,
connecting solidly with the mercenary’s head. The resulting *thunk* was
immensely satisfying, and the mercenary collapsed, out cold.
“Timber!” Borin announced cheerfully, turning his attention back to the
main fight. Silas, realizing he was now outnumbered and his primary weapon was
ineffective against the dwarf’s sonic defense, tried to flee towards the
stairs. Faelar anticipated the move, tripping him. Silas sprawled on the floor.
Before he could recover, Borin was there, planting a heavy boot on his chest.
“Going somewhere, apprentice?” Borin growled, his usual cheer replaced by
a grim satisfaction.
Faelar quickly bound Silas’s hands with a spare cord. The fight was over.
Silence descended, broken only by Borin’s heavy breathing and the distant
whisper of the wind outside. Faelar checked Master Elmsworth. As he suspected,
the old mage was gone.
“He played a dangerous game,” Faelar murmured, looking at the bound
apprentice. “And lost.”
Borin nudged Silas with his boot. “So, you killed him for a map fragment?”
Silas glared up at them, defeated but defiant. “It leads to the Vault of
Forgotten Stars! Elven magic and dwarven riches combined! It was my birthright,
discovered in his dusty old library! He tried to cheat me!”
Faelar retrieved the map fragment from his tunic, unrolling it carefully.
Vault of Forgotten Stars. He’d heard whispers of it in ancient elven texts
– a legend, a myth. Yet, here was a map. He looked at the dwarven runes, then
at the elven spire. “It seems,” he said, looking at Borin, “our quest
just became significantly more complicated. And interesting.”
Borin looked down at the map, then at the bound apprentice, then at Faelar. A
slow grin spread across his face. “Complicated? Interesting? Faelar, my
friend, this isn’t complicated! This is the beginning of the greatest ballad
ever sung! ‘The Saga of the Shadow Elf, the Stalwart Dwarf, and the
Star-Touched Vault’!” He beamed. “First, though,” he added, glancing
towards the window, “I believe we have a lute to retrieve. And maybe find the
town watch. This fellow needs lodging. Preferably barred.”

Retrieving the lute required Faelar’s ropes and Borin’s surprisingly
steady nerve at heights (aided, perhaps, by the promise of the adventure
ahead). They left Silas securely tied for the Cliffside watch, along with a
concise, anonymous note explaining the situation – omitting, of course, any
mention of a map fragment. As they walked away from Whisper Hill under the
light of a rising moon, the ebony lute safely stowed in a protective wrap Borin
had fashioned, a comfortable silence settled between them.
“You know,” Borin said finally, breaking the quiet, “for a pointy-eared
shadow-skulker, you’re not half bad in a scrap. That lute toss? Risky.
Brilliant, but risky.”
Faelar allowed himself a small smile, a rare occurrence. “And for a
bellowing, ale-swilling rock-dweller, your musical diversions are…
surprisingly effective. That chord you used against Silas’s magic?”
Borin puffed out his chest. “Ah, the Resonant Chord of Valour! An old
dwarven technique. Boosts courage, rattles nerves, and plays havoc with flimsy
air-magic. Takes good lungs, though.” He patted his barrel chest. “Good
acoustics.”
They walked on, the path leading away from Cliffside and towards the unknown
horizon hinted at by the map fragment now tucked securely away by Faelar. The
animosity that had defined their first meeting felt like a distant memory,
replaced by a burgeoning, unlikely camaraderie forged in shared danger and
mutual respect.
“So,” Borin asked, his eyes gleaming in the moonlight. “Where does the
map lead first? Mountains or spire?”
Faelar looked towards the jagged silhouette of distant peaks, then towards the
rolling hills that might eventually hide an ancient elven ruin. “I don’t
know,” he admitted. “Both paths hold secrets relevant to our peoples.
Perhaps… perhaps we don’t have to choose immediately.”
“Aye,” Borin agreed readily. “The road itself might tell us where to go.
And think of the taverns we’ll see! The stories we’ll gather! The songs
I’ll compose!” He struck an imaginary chord in the air.
Faelar found he didn’t even mind the gesture. The thought of traveling with
the dwarf, once an appalling prospect, now seemed… promising. Full of noise,
yes. Full of chaos, undoubtedly. But also full of courage, loyalty, and a
surprising amount of tactical value hidden beneath the boisterous exterior.
“Just try,” Faelar said, a hint of wry amusement in his voice, “not to
get us thrown out of every tavern between here and the Vault of Forgotten
Stars.”
Borin laughed, a deep, rumbling sound that echoed pleasantly in the quiet
night. “No promises, Faelar! No promises! But I guarantee one thing: it
won’t be boring!” He slung an arm briefly around the elf’s shoulders, a
gesture of easy companionship that Faelar, to his own surprise, didn’t shrug
off. They walked on together, an elf rogue and a dwarven bard, silhouetted
against the moonlit road, partners now not by necessity, but by choice.
Friends. The greatest adventure, the one mapped not on parchment but in shared
experience, had just begun.
