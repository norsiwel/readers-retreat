In the yawning maw of time, before iron had sung its song and wheels learned to
spin, nestled a tribe of stardust and fur called the Suncatchers. They dwelt in
a cave painted with amber sunrises, hearts as wild as the wind and hands
skilled in the dance of survival. One crisp dawn, the hunt pulsed in their
veins. Spearheads honed, nets woven tight, they ventured into the emerald
tapestry of the forest. Eola, leader of the hunt and mother to laughter,
stalked with the grace of a puma, her keen eyes spotting movement where leaves
whispered secrets. A rustle, a flash of fawn-colored fur, and the hunters
sprang. The chase, a breathless ballet of instinct and will, ended with a
magnificent stag succumbing to Eola's spear. Triumph echoed in their songs as
they carried their bounty back, the forest sighing its approval.

On the sun-dappled trail, fate unveiled a tiny pawprint, a waver in the
tapestry. Nestled beneath a whispering birch lay a whimpering ball of fur, eyes
wide with fear and loneliness. A lost pup, separated from its pack, its brown
coat blending with the fallen leaves. The Suncatchers, hearts seasoned by the
wild, couldn't turn away. Eola, remembering the warmth of her own pups, scooped
the trembling creature into her leathery hands. The children, eyes sparkling
with a new curiosity, named him Flint, echoing the sharp stones that kissed
their world.

Flint, a whirlwind of tail wags and puppy kisses, stole into their hearts with
the audacity of a sunbeam. He chased butterflies with the children, his yaps
weaving stories into the tapestry of the breeze. He'd cuddle by the crackling
fire, ears twitching to the lullaby of flames, a living ember against the
darkness. He brought laughter to their faces, a balm to the rough edges of
their world.

One day, the joy dimmed. Little Anya, eyes like pools of summer sky, stepped on
a hidden flint, a crimson bloom staining her foot. Infection, a silent
predator, stalked her from the shadows. Her fever skyrocketed, her laughter
muted to whimpers. The tribe huddled around her, prayers etched on their faces.

Then, as if guided by the moon's gentle hand, Flint padded to Anya's side. He
nuzzled her hand, then, with a lick so soft it was a whisper, bathed the
injured toe in his warm saliva. The tribe watched, a flicker of hope in their
eyes. In that lick, a gift from nature, resided a symphony of antibodies, a
primal alchemy battling the unseen foe.

As the sun painted the next dawn, a miracle unfolded. Anya's fever broke, her
eyes regaining their summer-sky sparkle. Flint, curled next to her, slept the
sleep of the warrior, his furry chest rising and falling like a gentle tide.
The tribe erupted in jubilation, singing hymns of gratitude to the spirits of
the wild.

From that day, a bond of steel forged with fire and licked clean by love
intertwined man and dog. Anya and Flint, two hearts beating as one, explored
the tapestry of the forest, their laughter echoing through the trees. He, her
protector, her furry shadow against the dangers lurking in the green. She, his
haven, his endless belly rubs and whispered secrets.

The tribe that lived in the cave were known for their close-knit community and
strong work ethic. They spent most of their time hunting and gathering food to
sustain their tribe. The cave was a small but cozy home, with a few rooms where
they lived and slept. They had made several improvements to the cave over the
years, such as adding more fire pits for warmth and improving the entrance to
keep out any dangerous animals or predators.

One of the most important members of the tribe was Flint, a strong and capable
hunter. Flint had taken a mate and brought her home with him, where they bred
and had several pups. The tribe was overjoyed at the arrival of these new dogs
and welcomed them into their community.

As the dogs grew older, they became an essential part of the tribe's daily
life. They would help in hunts by tracking down prey and bringing it back to
the tribe. Additionally, the dogs would sleep by the entrance of the cave to
protect the humans from any threats that might come their way.

The population of dogs continued to grow as more pups were born and raised
within the tribe. The tribe had 5 dogs in various states of age and sex, all
working together to help the tribe thrive. The addition of the dogs had a
significant impact on the tribe's daily life, making it easier to hunt and
gather food, and providing an extra layer of security for the humans.

Overall, the tribe was flourishing as a result of their hard work and
dedication. They continued to improve their cave and make it a safer and more
comfortable place to live. The dogs were an essential part of this success,
helping the tribe in various ways and bringing joy to their daily lives.
In the First Times, when the seasons turned intheir gentle rhythm, there dwelt
a tribe amid the rolling hills and hidden hollows of the limestone land. The
Firehearts, as they were called, made their home in a great cave etched with
the stories of their ancestors.

In those early days the Firehearts were few, yet their spirits burned bright.
Their chief, Eloi the Wise, led them through many turns of the seasons. When
the Earth Mother blossomed in her fullness, they would venture out to hunt,
returning with bounty to sustain them through the barren moons.

One bitter winter, after a disastrous hunt, a lone pup was found shivering
beneath a windswept stone. Though prey was scarce, the Firehearts could not
turn the whimpering creature away. The children named him Flint for his deep
grey coat, and welcomed him as one of their own.

Flint grew into a stalwart companion, helping herd prey during hunts and
guarding the cave entrance when shadows lengthened. A deep bond formed between
the foundling pup and Little Brook, the girl he had helped heal many seasons
before. The two became inseparable, venturing deep into the sun-dappled woods
and returning woven with leaf and laughter. With Flint by their side, the
Firehearts never had to feel alone.

In time, their numbers outgrew the sheltering cave that had been their home
since distant memory. After much counsel, Chief Eloi decreed that they must
spread their embers and settle new lands.

Not all rejoiced at this. Fear and uncertainty murmured through the tribe like
wind through bare branches. But Eloi spoke of plenty waiting beyond the
horizon, and promised they would grow stronger even as they grew apart.

At last they were convinced. With heavy hearts, the Firehearts gathered their
belongings and fanned out in many directions, their faithful hounds loping
beside them. Though now scattered, their spirits would remain woven together
like roots beneath the soil. And thanks to the friendship of man and dog, they
would never have to feel alone.

They dwelled in their new lands and wove new stories, prospering even as the
seasons turned. But on special days they would return to the old cave,
gathering around the hearth to reminisce of memories etched upon the stone. And
waiting to greet each traveler was always Flint, now white-muzzled with the
passage of time. Together again if only for a short while, they would speak of
old friends and days long gone though never forgotten.  In the First Times,
when the wheel of the seasons turned gentle and slow, there nestled a tribe
amidst the embrace of earth and sky who went by the name of Firehearts. Their
domain was a land of ancient stone, where patient rivers had carved the earth
into a landscape of rolling hills and hidden hollows. Great shattered slabs of
limestone littered the scrub-dotted plains, testaments to the land’s
turbulent birth. From the bosom of those fractured stones rose caves beyond
number, each one a sanctuary from life’s storms. The Firehearts dwelled in
one such cavern, their home a tapestry of sun-splashed stone etched with tales
of hunts, seasons turning and loved ones passed into night’s sweet kiss.

In the First Times, the Firehearts numbered little more than a longhouse of
souls. But oh, what a resplendent longhouse it was. Women with laughing eyes
and skillful hands, children bright with mischief as birdsong, men sturdy as
oaks under summer’s jeweled cloak. Joy and grief walked hand in hand there,
as is the way of life beneath sun, moon and stars.

Their chief, one Eloi the Wise, led through night’s dark whisperings into
each new dawn. In his broad chest he carried the stories, dreams and lessons of
countless grandmothers and grandfathers come before. With patience honed sharp
as any spearhead he guided his people through life’s ebb and flow. Stern when
lives hung in the balance, but quick to share breath and laughter when the
moment allowed.

As was custom stretching back beyond remembrance, the turning of seasons danced
to the throb of the hunt’s drumbeat. When the Earth Mother’s generous bosom
grew heavy with life, Eloi would lead his hunters into the leave’s green sea.
Across meadows jeweled with wildflowers, under the approving gaze of great
silent oaks, the hunters would venture. Their craft was hard won through long
years of reading wind and hoofprints upon the land’s face. Sharp spears and
skills honed to razor perfection brought down fleet stags, plump nesting birds
and other gifts from the standing folk.

Back to the sheltering cave they’d return, their bounty slung across sturdy
shoulders. The women sang songs of gratitude as they turned hide to leather,
feather to fletching and bone to spear points. Never was a morsel wasted. The
standing folk who had surrendered their lives so the Firehearts could sustain
theirs were shown all honor. Their spirits thanked with due reverence.

When the Earth Mother’s generous bosom grew lean and barren, the Great Cave
became the Firehearts’ world entire. Together they’d draw close to the
hearth fires’ life-giving warmth. Old bones were rendered into broth, the
last fruits of summer’s fleeting sweetness dried and stored. The hunters
ventured out only as needed, often returning with meager offerings. But return
they always did, to cheers and embrace. In the darkness of winter’s chill
grasp, each sunrise was a hard won treasure.

The seasons turned and turned again, a great woven dance without beginning or
end. The Firehearts nurtured babies from squalling infancy to laughing children
to stalwart adults. Loved ones grew stooped and frail, their eyes dimming as
they gazed to the sunset realms beyond. The young buried the old with tears and
celebration, as all things pass in their proper time.

In this manner the Firehearts marked the advent of many generations. With each
handsome summer and bitter winter they etched deeper wisdom into their home of
living stone. Of the turning seasons’ rhythm they grew ever more attuned,
until they breathed all but as one with the land’s tides of life and death.
Hardship was no stranger, but through it together they persevered.

Until one year, the Dance Faltered.

It began with Little Brook, an ember-haired child blessed with her mother’s
spirited laugh. Whilst at play she severed her foot on a javelin head crafted
more keen than wise. The hunters, flat bellies and failure-bowed shoulders, had
spent the dark months fashioning weapons more fit to pierce mammoth hide than
for a child’s hands. Despite the healers’ chants and poultices, infection
took root in Little Brook’s wound as a fell shadow claiming virgin soil.

The Earth Mother turned Her back that bitter season, sending storms of such
fury the hunters could scarce set foot outside without risking ghostly claim.
Prey grew scarce and wan. The child’s fever climbed as inexorably as sapling
reaching for sky. All thought the last sunrise soon at hand for the laughing,
dancing soul they so adored.

In the darkest hour, the White Wolf emerged from night’s veil.

Few tales live longer than the Firehearts’ telling of that solemn moon. How
the snows fell thicker than ash, denying world beyond the cave but grey fleece
and accusing wind. How hope guttered to faintest cinder, leaving naught but
waiting for the inevitable. Howl of wolf pierces the mourning silence. A
ghostly face appears, framed between ice-encrusted jambs. Eyes alight with
winter’s own blue fire, yet warm with compassion.

The White Wolf slips into the cave on snow-silenced feet. Sniffing the fetid
air, a low rumble stirs his frost-rimed chest. Heads bow as he approaches the
fevered child, laid atop a bed of faded furs and grief. None dare challenge his
passage, for he is no ordinary beast. With mournful air he settles beside the
girl, rests his great muzzle across her wounded leg. Those burning blue eyes
slide shut. His flank rises, falls, rises again in steady cadence.

In silence the Firehearts keep vigil through the night. The only sound the soft
crackle of embers struggling against encroaching dark.

Dawn breaches. A collective breath escapes in wonder as wan light reveals
Little Brook slumbering peacefully, her skin cool to the touch. The White Wolf
is gone, with no trail or trace he ever haunted there. When at last she opens
her eyes, they shine with summer’s warmth once more. Laughter, a sound sore
missed, echoes anew off cave walls once shrouded in Winter’s clutch.

None recall seeing the White Wolf before that night, nor have they since. But
from that day on he lived on in Fireheart legend, revered as an emissary from
the Earth Mother herself. The cave bears a ring of stones and a humble altar
where regular gifts are laid to honor the blessing he bestowed. And fires are
kept burning through the darkest hours, lest he return and find their
hospitality wanting.

Seasons turned and turned again. The Firehearts’ number slowly grew, as did
their fame. Songs and stories drifted on the wind, exalting Eloi’s wisdom and
kindness, the cave kept warm and the White Wolf honored. Others who struggled
alone saw in the Firehearts’ life a gleam of hope, an answer to the howling
void that is oneself diminished. They came, weary and hungry for tribe and
purpose. From near and far they trickled, until the cave ran over with new life
and laughter.

Under Eloi’s guidance the newcomers found purpose, bonded with their adopted
kin and vowed to serve the greater tribe. Men whose spears had only known the
solitude of the self-hunt learned to beat as one heart with their brothers.
Lonely women filled the void left by their barren wombs by nourishing the
tribe’s young as their own. Elders long forgotten by their blood rediscovered
beloved purpose in kindling warmth, spinning wisdom and guiding eager hands.

Many eager hands were needed indeed. For even the Earth Mother’s generous
bosom has limits unknown till pressed. The erstwhile sheltering cavern grew
cramped and close with so many souls beneath one stone roof. Game traveled
further afield, no longer grazing beneath the tribe’s very doorstep. Firewood
lasted not from one dawn till the next.

After many council fires and nights spent in troubled sleep, Eloi came to a
heavy decision. The Firehearts must spread their embers, flowering anew in
fresh soil. It was the way of life to seek its proper shape, continuous as
ripples on pond’s face. This cave, which had nurtured them all from mewling
babe to tottering elder, must now be but the trunk of a greater tree.

When at last Eloi spoke his decree, not all hearts beat as one. Shocked
whispers hissed like wind through naked branches. Faces once bright as poppy
blooms furrowed with doubt’s creeping shadow. The women drew the wee ones
close, their eyes suspicious flints. For who were they, if not the Firehearts?
What shape could flame take but what their grandmothers did before?

Eloi spoke again, hands spread like an elder oak’s welcoming limbs. He
soothed their fretting souls with promises of plenty in days to come. Reminded
them of the White Wolf’s blessing, and how Elei himself had welcomed many
present from beyond the horizon. Now was merely the season to offer such
