                          More Than Burden
                            by Norsiwel

The sun blistered the endless desert. Sand stretched in every direction, a
golden sea baking under the merciless sky. Distant mountains shimmered on the
horizon like a mirage, promising shelter that might not exist. Above, three
vultures circled in widening spirals, their shadows fleeting across the dunes.

Marta adjusted her cracked leather canteen, the rough strap biting into her
shoulder. Her throat burned with thirst, each swallow scraping like sandpaper.
The dry wind carried the faint scent of something dead, something the vultures
would soon claim. A bead of sweat traced a path through the dust on her cheek,
cooling for just a moment before evaporating.

She checked her compass again, though she knew the bearings by heart. North led
to the mountains. East led to certain death in the sun-scorched flats. Her
fingers trembled as she traced the compass needle.

Marta chose north.

The desert sun hung heavy in the cloudless sky, baking the cracked earth
beneath a solitary mule's hooves. Dust clung to his brown coat as he followed
the familiar trail toward the distant mountains. His ears twitched at the
unusual silence—no birds, no wind, just the rhythmic crunch of his own
footsteps on the parched ground.

Then he saw it—a shape lying motionless beside the path. The mule stopped,
nostrils flaring at the scent of sweat and fear. A man lay face down in the
dirt, his travel-worn cloak half-buried in sand. One arm stretched toward an
empty waterskin, fingers curled like dried twigs.

The mule circled once, tail swishing against flies. "You alive, stranger?" he
asked, voice rough from disuse. No response came except shallow breathing. He
nudged the man's shoulder with his nose, feeling the feverish heat through the
fabric.

Water sloshed in his own saddlebags, but sharing meant less for himself. The
mule shifted his weight, considering the mountains still days away. His stomach
tightened at the thought of extra burden, yet the man's labored breaths echoed
his own memories of thirst.

A fly landed on the traveler's neck, and the mule blew sharply through his
nostrils, startling it away. The man stirred slightly, whispering words lost in
the heat haze.

The mule lowered himself to his knees beside the fallen traveler, the leather
straps of his pack creaking in protest. "Can you hear me?" he repeated, louder
this time. The man's eyelids fluttered but didn't open.

Sunlight glinted off the waterskin lying nearby, reminding the mule of his own
dry throat. He could leave now, continue his journey alone as he always had.
But the memory of his last drought—when kindness had come unexpectedly to
him—pulled at his resolve.

With a sigh that stirred the dust between his hooves, the mule made his choice.
He nudged the waterskin toward the traveler with his nose, then positioned
himself to be mounted. "Drink first," he instructed the unconscious man. "Then
we'll see about getting you upright."

The mule pressed his shoulder against the traveler's side, heaving with his
hindquarters to roll him onto his back. Sunlight caught the man's cracked lips
as he coughed dust. "Drink," the mule repeated, nudging the waterskin against
the man's hand. When fingers twitched around the leather, the mule lowered
himself further, pressing his muzzle to the man's palm—showing where to grip
the saddle.

Sand shifted beneath the mule's hooves as the traveler's weight settled
unevenly. One leg dangled uselessly while the other hooked over the mule's
withers. The man's breathing came in ragged gasps that matched the mule's own
quickened pulse. A fly buzzed near the traveler's ear, but this time the mule
didn't shoo it away—the man needed to wake properly or they'd never make it.

"Left foot in the stirrup," the mule instructed, shifting to angle the leather
loop toward the traveler's searching hand. The man's fingers brushed empty air
twice before catching the worn leather. His knuckles were white with effort,
but the mule felt the subtle redistribution of weight as the man found purchase.

They remained like that for a long moment—the mule braced against the man's
unsteady mounting, the traveler gripping the saddle horn with trembling hands.
The mule could feel the man's exhaustion radiating through the leather, smell
the salt of his sweat mixing with the desert air. One waterskin sloshed
half-empty against the mule's flank, the sound punctuating their fragile
arrangement.

The traveler's head lolled forward, his breath hot against the mule's neck.
"Mountains," he whispered, words barely audible over the wind. "Must reach the
mountains."

The mule snorted, shaking his head to dislodge a fly. "Mountains don't move,
stranger. But you will—if you want to live." He shifted his stance,
deliberately making it harder for the man to stay mounted. "Grip with your
knees or slide off. Your choice."

The man's legs tightened reflexively, heels pressing against the mule's ribs. A
spark of awareness flickered in his sunken eyes as he straightened slightly in
the saddle. His hand released the saddle horn to wipe grit from his face, then
returned with firmer grip.

The mule took one experimental step forward. The traveler swayed but held on,
his breathing steadying into something closer to control. Another step, then
another, each testing whether the arrangement would hold. The mountains
remained distant, but now they had a rhythm—hoofbeats matching heartbeat, the
creak of leather joining their shared breath.

When the mule reached the crest of a small dune, he stopped to survey the path
ahead. The traveler's head had begun to nod again, his grip slackening. The
mule turned his head just enough to nudge the man's thigh with his nose. "Eyes
open," he ordered. "First rule of desert travel—you don't sleep until you've
found shade."

The traveler blinked slowly, then focused on the mule's ear. "Why help me?" he
asked, voice raw.

The mule considered the question as he scanned the horizon for landmarks. "Last
drought," he said finally, "a jackrabbit showed me where to dig for water." He
started walking again, his pace measured to the traveler's fragile balance.
"Turns out kindness travels both ways."

The sun beat down as they continued, the mule adjusting his gait to accommodate
the extra weight. When the traveler's breathing grew shallow again, the mule
made his choice. He angled toward a cluster of rocks offering scant shade, his
hooves kicking up small puffs of dust with each deliberate step.

The wizard's fingers tightened around the saddle horn as they crested another
dune, his knuckles pale against the worn leather. His head bobbed forward with
each step, chin bumping against his chest. The mule felt the subtle shift in
weight distribution as consciousness slipped away—the wizard's legs loosened
their grip, his body swaying with the rhythm of hooves on sand.

"Stay with me," the mule warned, angling his shoulder to keep the wizard
upright. A strand of gray hair escaped the man's hood, fluttering in the dry
wind. When no response came except steady breathing, the mule slowed to a
careful walk, adjusting his gait to minimize jostling.

The wizard slid sideways, one arm dangling toward the ground. The mule stopped
abruptly, causing the wizard to lurch forward and grab the saddle again.
"You're not done yet," he said, voice firm despite the heat haze shimmering
between them. "Mountains don't care if you're tired."

They reached a shallow wash where sparse grass clung to life. The mule angled
toward the slight shade of a boulder, his hooves sinking slightly in the cooler
earth. The wizard's head lolled against the mule's neck, his breathing deep and
even now. A faint smell of burnt sage and something metallic—magic,
perhaps—rose from his robes.

The mule considered nudging him awake. They needed to make camp before sunset,
find water before dark. But the wizard's hand had gone slack on the reins, his
face relaxed in genuine rest for the first time since they'd begun. The mule
remembered his own last long journey, how dangerous exhaustion could be.

Sunlight glinted off the wizard's silver staff, half-visible in the saddlebag.
The mountains loomed larger now, their peaks still distant but no longer hazy
mirages. The mule calculated the remaining water—enough for tonight if they
found shelter soon.

A lizard darted across the sand, disappearing into a crevice. The mule stood
perfectly still, letting the wizard sleep against his neck. The man's breath
warmed the mule's coarse hair, steady and deep. One waterskin sloshed gently
against the mule's flank, the sound almost lost beneath the whisper of wind
through dry grass.

The mule turned his head just enough to see the wizard's face—the deep lines
around his eyes, the dust caked in his beard. This wasn't just exhaustion; this
was the wear of someone who hadn't properly rested in days. Maybe weeks.

When the wizard's hat slipped sideways, revealing a fresh scar along his
temple, the mule made his choice. He took a slow step forward, then another,
keeping his gait smooth as polished stone. The wizard didn't stir, his
breathing unchanged. The mule adjusted his path toward a cluster of rocks that
would provide shelter from the night wind.

As the sun began its descent, painting the desert in long shadows, the mule
continued his careful pace. Each step was deliberate, each movement calculated
to preserve the wizard's fragile rest. The mountains drew nearer with every
dune they crossed, their promise of whatever lay beyond growing more tangible
with each careful hoofbeat.

The mule's ears flicked at the sound of distant thunder—unusual for this
season. He glanced at the sleeping wizard, then at the gathering clouds to the
west. With a soft snort that didn't disturb his passenger, the mule altered
course slightly, heading for a narrow canyon that would offer protection if the
weather turned.

The mule's hooves sank slightly into the cooling sand as he climbed the gentle
slope of another dune. The wizard remained slumped against his neck, breathing
deep and even. A single drop of sweat traced a path through the dust on the
mule's shoulder, the cool evening air making it evaporate before it could reach
his flank.

Beast of burden, they called him. Just another pack animal. The mule remembered
the stable boy's laughter when he'd first spoken - how the boy dropped his
bucket and ran screaming to the master. "Cursed beast!" they'd called him then,
too, though they kept him working all the same.

Sunlight glinted off the wizard's silver staff as it shifted in the saddlebag.
The mule felt the man's steady breath against his neck, warm and rhythmic. What
was an old wizard doing out here alone, half-dead in the desert? The mule had
carried merchants and soldiers, pilgrims and thieves, but never someone who
smelled of burnt sage and magic.

His muscles ached with the unfamiliar weight, but it was a good ache. Different
from the empty ache of carrying sacks of grain for masters who never spoke a
kind word. This weight had purpose, even if the wizard couldn't say what it
was. The mule's ears flicked at the memory of the jackrabbit - how small
kindnesses sometimes led to bigger ones.

The mountains loomed larger now, no longer distant mirages but solid shapes
against the darkening sky. A breeze carried the scent of something green from
the high valleys. The mule adjusted his pace as the wizard shifted in his
sleep, one hand slipping from the saddle horn.

"Easy there," the mule murmured, slowing to give the wizard time to reposition.
The man's fingers found the leather again, gripping with unconscious strength.
His breathing deepened, the rhythm matching the mule's own steady heartbeat.

They reached the crest of the dune, where the land sloped gently downward
toward a rocky outcrop. The mule stopped to survey the path ahead, his shadow
stretching long across the sand. The wizard's hat had slipped back, revealing
deep lines around his closed eyes. Not just exhaustion - this was the wear of
someone who'd seen too much.

The mule remembered the stable boy's laughter, how he'd pretended not to
understand human speech just to avoid more trouble. Carrying silent burdens was
easier than speaking up. But silence hadn't saved him from the whip when the
grain sacks fell, or from the cold nights in the stall.

A coyote howled in the distance, the sound echoing through the gathering
twilight. The mule felt the wizard shiver against his neck, though the desert
night was still warm. He took a slow step forward, then another, keeping his
gait smooth as river stone. The mountains called with their silent promise,
whatever waited there.

The mule's hooves crunched softly on the gravel as they descended the dune. His
breathing came steady and deep, matching the wizard's sleeping rhythm. This
burden felt different - not just weight to carry, but a journey to share. For
the first time since the jackrabbit showed him water, the mule didn't feel
quite so alone on the trail.

When the wizard's staff slipped from the saddlebag again, the mule stopped
deliberately to let it fall. He nudged it with his nose toward the man's
dangling hand. "Take it," he said quietly. "You'll need it where we're going."

The mountains waited, silent and patient. The mule continued walking, carrying
his sleeping passenger toward whatever answers lay ahead.

The mule's hooves crunched softly on the rocky path as they entered the
canyon's shadow. Moonlight filtered through the narrow opening above, painting
stripes across the wizard's face. The man stirred slightly, his breathing
changing from deep sleep to something closer to awareness.

One hand lifted slowly, fingers curling in the air as if grasping something
invisible. The silver staff leapt from the sand where it had fallen, spinning
once before landing perfectly in the wizard's palm. A faint blue glow pulsed
along its length, illuminating the deep lines around the man's closed eyes.

The mule stopped walking, ears pricked forward at the sudden warmth radiating
from the staff. He felt the hum through his hooves before he heard it—a low
vibration that made the dust on his coat tremble. The wizard's fingers
tightened around the staff, then relaxed as his hand dropped back to the
saddle, the glow fading to a soft ember.

"Three peaks," the wizard murmured, his voice rough but clearer than before.
His thumb brushed a symbol carved near the staff's tip. "Almost there..." His
head lolled forward again, sleep reclaiming him before the sentence finished.

The mule took a careful step forward, then another. The canyon walls narrowed
ahead, forcing him to choose between two paths—the wider route with loose
scree, or the tighter passage with smooth stone. He remembered the stable boy's
warning about narrow spaces: "Corners catch cursed beasts like you."

Mountains now dominated the horizon, their three peaks unmistakable against the
starry sky. The air carried the scent of pine from the high valleys, cool and
sharp after the desert heat. The mule's muscles ached with the long journey,
but the wizard's steady breathing against his neck kept him moving.

The staff pulsed again as the wizard shifted in his sleep, casting flickering
shadows on the canyon walls. For a moment, the mule saw shapes in those
shadows—figures moving with purpose, watching their progress. He shook his
head, the motion causing the wizard to grip the saddle more tightly in his
sleep.

They reached the fork in the path. The wider route showed recent animal
tracks—likely mountain lions. The narrow passage offered safer footing but
would require the mule to scrape his sides against the rock. He turned his head
to check the wizard's condition, noting how pale the man's face looked in the
moonlight.

A breeze carried the sound of running water from the narrow path. The mule
remembered the jackrabbit's lesson about water sources. He nudged the wizard
gently with his nose, but the man only murmured in his sleep, fingers
tightening around the staff.

The mule considered his options. Waking the wizard might help choose the safer
path, but the man needed every moment of rest. The staff's glow had revealed
something important back at the canyon entrance—the shadows had shown more
than just rock formations.

He stepped toward the narrow passage, his shoulder brushing the cool stone. The
wizard didn't stir. The staff pulsed once, then went dark as they entered the
tighter space. The mule's breathing slowed to match the wizard's, each step
deliberate on the smooth stone floor.

When they emerged from the canyon, the mountains stood before them—no longer
distant shapes but immediate presence. The mule stopped at the canyon's mouth,
surveying the final stretch. The wizard's breathing changed again, becoming
more alert even in sleep.

The mule made his choice. He angled toward the pine-scented breeze, his hooves
finding sure footing on the rocky slope. The staff glowed faintly in response,
as if acknowledging the path he'd chosen.

Moonlight caught the wizard's staff as he woke fully for the first time in
days. His fingers traced the carved symbol near the top—a twin spiral
representing family lineage. The memory struck him like a physical blow:
Marta's small hand gripping his as the sandstorm swallowed her, her voice lost
in the howling wind. "Papa, don't let go!" she'd cried, the last words he heard
before the world turned to dust.

He sat up too quickly, dizziness washing over him as the mule stopped walking.
"Three days," the wizard rasped, his voice raw from disuse. "She's been out
there three days alone."

The mule turned his head, one dark eye meeting the wizard's gaze. "You didn't
tell me you were traveling with family."

The wizard's hand trembled as he touched the staff's twin spiral. A faint blue
light pulsed in response, showing an image in the air between them—Marta's
compass, lying buried in sand, its needle spinning wildly. The image dissolved
into dust motes that stung the wizard's eyes.

"She has no water left," he said, the words scraping his throat. "No shelter
from the sun."

The mule shifted his weight, hooves crunching on the rocky path. "Mountains are
close now. Shelter. Water. Safety."

The wizard's fingers tightened around the staff as another vision came
unbidden—a vulture circling over a small figure struggling up a dune. He saw
the cracked leather of her canteen, the way her hand kept going to her hip
where the compass should be. The same compass he'd given her on her twelfth
birthday, when she first showed magical talent.

The mule lowered his head to drink from the waterskin hanging at his side. When
he lifted his muzzle, droplets glistened on his whiskers. "I found you
half-dead in the sand," he said quietly. "You think I'd leave you there?"

The wizard stared at the path ahead, where the mountain pass promised safety
within hours. Then he looked back the way they'd come, imagining Marta's
footsteps already erased by the wind. His stomach clenched with the memory of
her last words: "If we get separated, meet at the oasis."

The staff pulsed again, showing the oasis—dry and cracked, abandoned years
ago. A mirage of hope that had led her astray.

The mule followed his gaze toward the dark expanse of desert behind them.
"That's where she is, isn't it?"

The wizard nodded, his throat too tight to speak. He remembered teaching Marta
how to read the stars, how she'd laughed when she got them backward. "She'll
try to follow the North Star," he managed. "But without water..."

A cool breeze carried the scent of pine from the mountains. The mule stood
perfectly still, waiting.

The wizard touched the staff to the ground, tracing a circle in the dust.
Within it, the twin spiral glowed brighter. "We were supposed to reach the
mountains together," he said. "She was coming of age ceremony..."

The mule snorted, shaking his head. "Prophecies don't matter when someone's
dying in the sand." He shifted his stance, leather straps creaking. "I carried
you when you couldn't walk. I'll carry both of you if I must."

The wizard closed his eyes, seeing Marta's face as she disappeared into the
storm. He felt the weight of the staff in his hand, the promise he'd made to
her mother on her deathbed. The mountains called with their promise of safety,
but the desert held his daughter.

When he opened his eyes, the staff's light had dimmed to a soft glow. The mule
stood patiently, one hoof tapping the ground in a steady rhythm.

The wizard's hand shook as he uncorked the waterskin. Water splashed across his
dusty beard as he drank deeply, the cool liquid tracing a path down his parched
throat. He swallowed three times before lowering the skin, droplets glistening
on his cracked lips.

"Help me sit straight," he instructed the mule, who pressed his shoulder
against the wizard's back. The wizard placed both hands on the staff, the twin
spiral glowing with increasing intensity. His voice emerged as a dry whisper
that grew stronger with each word: "By blood and bone, by sand and stone,
return what the desert holds alone."

The staff flared with blue light, illuminating the wizard's tear-streaked face.
The mule backed away as the light expanded, forming a circle on the ground that
pulsed with ancient symbols. Sand swirled within the circle, rising in a
miniature whirlwind that carried the scent of dry earth and desperation.

Marta appeared within the circle, collapsing to her knees. Her clothes hung in
tatters, her skin burned red by the sun. She tried to lift her head but lacked
the strength, her fingers digging into the sand as she fought to stay conscious.

The wizard scrambled toward her on unsteady legs, his staff forgotten on the
ground. He cradled her face in his hands, thumbs brushing away the dust and
tears. "Marta," he whispered, his voice breaking on her name.

She tried to speak but only managed a dry cough, her tongue too swollen to form
words. Her eyes fluttered open for a moment, recognition flashing through the
haze of dehydration before closing again.

The mule nudged the waterskin toward the wizard with his nose. "Half for her,"
he said quietly. "Too much too fast will make her sick."

The wizard nodded, hands trembling as he lifted Marta's head. He poured a
single sip into her mouth, waiting as she swallowed with visible effort. A
second sip followed, then a third, each one bringing her slightly back from the
edge of unconsciousness.

Marta's fingers twitched against the wizard's arm, grasping for purchase. Her
breathing came in shallow gasps that matched the rapid pulse in her throat. The
wizard brushed a strand of hair from her forehead, his calloused fingers
lingering on her feverish skin.

The mule circled them once, assessing Marta's condition. "She's burning up," he
observed. "Sun's done its work."

The wizard's jaw tightened as he noticed the cracked leather of Marta's canteen
still strapped to her hip. He carefully unfastened it, his stomach clenching at
the empty container. "How long has she been without water?"

"Three days," the mule replied. "Maybe four. Desert doesn't keep time for the
lost."

Marta stirred again, her lips moving silently. The wizard leaned closer,
catching the faintest whisper: "North... mountains..."

"I know, my love," he said, his voice thick with emotion. "You were so close."

The mule shifted his weight, leather straps creaking. "You need to get her
cooled down before the fever takes her."

The wizard looked from Marta's flushed face to the mountains still visible in
the distance. The canyon they'd just passed offered shelter from the wind, but
returning would cost precious time. The open path ahead led to the pine-scented
valley with its promise of fresh water, but exposed Marta to the elements.

Marta coughed again, a dry, painful sound that made her whole body tense. Her
fingers tightened weakly around the wizard's sleeve, a silent plea for help.

The mule lowered himself to his knees beside them. "I can carry both of you,"
he offered. "But we need to move now."

The wizard stroked Marta's hair back from her forehead, feeling the dangerous
heat radiating from her skin. He remembered the dry oasis in the staff's
vision, how Marta had followed false hope into deeper danger. Her compass lay
buried somewhere in the desert, a testament to her determination.

He glanced at the canyon behind them, then at the valley ahead. The mountains
called with their promise of safety, but Marta needed immediate care. The mule
waited patiently, one hoof tapping the ground in a steady rhythm.

The wizard pressed his palm against Marta's cheek, feeling her shallow breath
against his skin. Her eyelids fluttered but didn't open. He could see the faint
outline of her collarbone through her torn shirt, the way her throat worked as
she tried to swallow.

The mule followed his gaze. "She won't last the night without proper care."

The wizard nodded, his throat too tight to speak. He remembered teaching Marta
to read the stars, how she'd laughed when she got them backward. That same
laugh had warmed their campfire nights, had carried them through difficult
journeys. Now her breathing came in shallow gasps that matched the rapid pulse
in her throat.

He looked at the waterskin, then at the mountains. The staff lay nearby, its
twin spiral still faintly glowing. The canyon would provide immediate shelter,
but the valley held real water and cooler temperatures.

Marta's hand tightened around his sleeve with surprising strength. Her eyes
opened just enough to meet his gaze, a silent question in their depths.

The wizard brushed dust from her cheek with his thumb, feeling the heat
radiating from her skin. He made his choice. "We're going to the valley," he
told the mule. "Full speed."

Marta's breathing steadied as the moon climbed higher. Her fingers unclenched
from the wizard's sleeve, the knuckles slowly losing their white pallor. The
wizard pressed the back of his hand to her forehead, feeling the fever begin to
recede as she drifted between consciousness and sleep.

The mule lowered himself to his knees beside them, careful not to disturb the
delicate balance of recovery. He watched Marta's chest rise and fall with
increasing regularity, the shallow gasps gradually deepening into proper
breaths. A single drop of water clung to her lower lip, catching the moonlight
as it trembled with each exhale.

"You saved her," the wizard said, his voice rough but steady. He reached for
the waterskin, pouring a careful stream into Marta's mouth. She swallowed
reflexively, a faint color returning to her parched lips.

The mule shifted his weight, leather straps creaking softly. "Someone had to."

The wizard stroked Marta's hair back from her forehead, his thumb brushing away
a streak of dried salt where tears had cut through the dust. Her eyelids
fluttered but didn't open. "She would have made it," he murmured. "She always
finds a way."

"Not always," the mule replied, his voice barely above a whisper. "Three days
without water... that's cutting it close even for someone with her spirit."

The wizard nodded, his throat working as he swallowed. He remembered teaching
Marta to read the stars, how she'd laughed when she got them backward. That
same laugh had warmed their campfire nights, had carried them through difficult
journeys. Now her breathing came in steady rhythms that matched the slow pulse
in her throat.

Marta stirred, her hand finding the wizard's wrist with surprising strength.
Her fingers were no longer dry and brittle but held the faint moisture of
recovery. She opened her eyes just enough to meet his gaze, a silent question
in their depths.

"I'm here," he whispered, pressing his palm against her cheek. "Rest now."

She closed her eyes again, her breathing deepening as sleep claimed her once
more. The wizard watched her chest rise and fall, counting each breath until he
was certain she was truly resting.

The mule stood perfectly still, one hoof tapping the ground in a steady rhythm.
"She's strong," he observed. "Like her mother."

The wizard's hand tightened almost imperceptibly around Marta's wrist. "You
knew her mother?"

"Knew of her," the mule corrected. "The desert remembers everyone who passes
through."

Silence settled between them, broken only by Marta's steady breathing and the
distant call of a night bird. The wizard traced the twin spiral on his staff
with his free hand, the wood smooth from years of handling.

"What should I call you?" the wizard asked suddenly.

The mule's ears flicked forward. "Call me?"

"You've carried us both through the desert," the wizard said. "Saved my
daughter's life. You deserve a name."

The mule lowered his head, watching a beetle scuttle across the sand. "I've
never had one. Just 'mule' or 'beast' or 'pack animal'."

"Names matter," the wizard said softly. "They hold power. My mother named me
for the stars."

The mule snorted, shaking his head. "I'm no star. Just a working animal."

Marta stirred in her sleep, her fingers twitching against the wizard's hand.
The wizard watched her for a moment, then turned back to the mule. "You carried
me when I couldn't walk. You turned back for my daughter when safety was within
reach. That's not just a working animal."

The mule shifted his weight, avoiding the wizard's gaze. "Animals don't need
names."

"But friends do," the wizard countered. He studied the mule's face—the
intelligent eyes, the strong jaw, the way his ears moved with understanding.
"You've earned the right to be more than just 'mule'."

A cool breeze carried the scent of pine from the mountains. The mule stood
perfectly still, waiting.

The wizard placed his free hand on the mule's neck, feeling the steady pulse
beneath the coarse hair. "My daughter's name means 'light' in the old tongue.
She brought light to my darkest days."

The mule's breathing slowed, matching Marta's steady rhythm.

"When you found me in the desert," the wizard continued, "you were the first
thing I saw through the heat haze—a dark shape against the sun. A shadow that
became my salvation."

He paused, considering. "In the old tongue, 'Desmon' means 'shadow that
protects'. It was my father's name."

The mule's eyes widened slightly. "That's... too much honor for a pack animal."

"You're more than that," the wizard said firmly. "You're Desmon now. Will you
accept this name?"

Marta stirred again, her breathing changing as she moved toward wakefulness.
The wizard kept his hand on the mule's neck, feeling the subtle tension in the
muscles beneath his palm.

The mule considered the offer, his gaze fixed on the mountains that had been
their destination. The stars reflected in his dark eyes as he weighed the
significance of what was being offered—not just a name, but recognition of
his worth.

Finally, he lowered his head in a slow nod. "Desmon," he repeated, testing the
sound. "I accept."

The wizard's hand tightened briefly on the mule's neck. "Welcome to the family,
Desmon."

Marta's fingers tightened around the wizard's wrist, her eyes opening fully for
the first time since her rescue. She looked from her father to the mule,
confusion giving way to understanding as she registered the momentous exchange.

The wizard smiled down at her, his thumb brushing a stray tear from her cheek.
"We have a new traveling companion," he said softly. "His name is Desmon."

Marta reached out a trembling hand toward the mule. Desmon lowered his head to
meet her touch, his dark eyes holding hers.

The wizard watched them connect, feeling the weight of responsibility lift
slightly from his shoulders. He had thought this journey would be just him and
Marta, but the desert had provided an unexpected ally.

Desmon shifted his stance, leather straps creaking. "We should make camp
properly," he suggested. "The valley isn't far now."

The wizard nodded, helping Marta sit up slowly. She was still weak, but the
color had returned to her face. Her hand found the wizard's arm for support,
her grip firm despite her exhaustion.

Desmon moved to position himself for mounting, his movements careful and
deliberate. "Who rides with whom?" he asked.

The wizard looked at Marta, then at Desmon. Marta was still too weak to travel
alone, but the wizard needed to keep his hands free for healing magic if needed.

The wizard made his choice. "Marta with you," he decided. "I'll walk and keep
watch."
