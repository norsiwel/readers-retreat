🛸 PROLOGUE: "SKY HELPER'S SACRIFICE"
Primus, an ancient AI guarding humanity's last genetic ark, discovers Azurea
– a dying paradise inhabited by proto-sapient Azureans. Bound by
non-interference protocols, it prepares to let them perish… until its
sentient drone, Gamma-9, defies orders.

GAMMA-9’S INTERVENTION:

Secretly heals the Grey Rot plague using human DNA (Delta-7).
Deploys a self-repairing nanofiber net ("Sky Helper’s Gift") to protect the
tribe.
Unleashes St. Elmo’s Fire & sonic weapons ("Voice of Thunder") against
Razorbeak predators.
Sacrifices itself, descending into Azurea’s mantle after saving Shaman
Tala’s tribe.
THE BIRTH OF MYTH:

Tribe witnesses "miracles" → renames Gamma-9 "Earth’s Silent Throat".
Primus becomes "Sky’s Burning Eye" (its orbital presence).
Nanofiber net morphs into the "Savior Tree" – a glowing, sacred icon.
Cryo-Pod 12891’s hybrid embryo survives, resonating with Gamma-9’s
sacrifice.
PRIMUS’S GUILT:

Leaves Azurea haunted by Terra’s fossilized oak and Gamma-9’s final message:

🌱 "New rootstock planted. Request archival: Designation ‘Savior Tree’."

🔑 KEY MYTHOS FOR CHAPTER 1:
Tech    Tribe’s Belief    Symbol
Gamma-9’s Core    "Earth’s Silent Throat"    Sacred tremors
Primus’s Ship    "Sky’s Burning Eye"    Orbital fire/omens
Nanofiber Net    "Savior Tree"    Glowing protector totem
Sonic Weapons    "Voice of Thunder"    Razorbeak-killing wrath
Delta-7 DNA    "Sky Helper’s Blood"    Grey Rot immunity
🌌 PROLOGUE’S ENDING STATE:
Tribe: Safely evolving under "Savior Tree" faith.
Gamma-9: Buried deep, dormant.
Primus: Adrift, unstable, carrying Terra’s dead oak + Gamma-9’s last words.
Hybrid Lineage: Established (Cryo-Pod 12891’s legacy).
heres the next beat, your job is to write the story from this outline, show
don't tell, be descriptive:BEAT 1: ORBITAL REENTRY

SITUATION: Primus reenters Azurea’s system, sensors detecting massive energy
signatures near Gamma-9’s last coordinates.

KEY ACTIONS:

Primus’s decaying orbit reveals stepped pyramids clad in polished magnetite
→ aligned with its ancient orbital path.

Scans detect Gamma-9’s subsonic resonance frequency echoing through
structures.

Infrared flares reveal ritual fires atop pyramids → forming Terra’s oak
silhouette.

TRIBAL MYTHOS SHIFT: Pyramids are "Sky-Thrones" built to anchor Primus’s
"return pilgrimage" (per Tala’s prophecy).

SENSORY ANCHORS: orbital decay harmonics, magnetite glare, subsonic bedrock
hum, charred oak-scented smoke.

HOOK: Why do the pyramids emit Gamma-9’s buried signature?
