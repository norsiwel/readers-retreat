The opulence of the Elysium Suite pressed in on Vinny like a gilded cage. His worn leather jacket felt out of place amongst the sculpted alabaster and shimmering chrome.  A wave of nausea rolled over him – not from the synthetic perfume that smelled vaguely of fresh rain and ozone, but from the raw memory essence clinging to the air like smoke. It was a heady cocktail of triumph, yearning, and bitter grief. This wasn’t just any dying man's final exhale; it was Julian Comstock, trillionaire industrialist, leaking his most precious moments onto the atmosphere itself.

“The vault is ready,” chirped the holographic attendant, its synthetic smile too wide, too bright against the melancholic blue glow of the suite. “Mr. Comstock’s neural signature indicates peak emotional resonance with the target memory.”

Vinny scowled.  Peak emotional resonance meant astronomical prices for memory brokers  but also meant the most volatile concoctions, prone to overloading even seasoned thieves like him. He ran a hand over his shaved head, feeling the faint ghost of phantom hair follicles where he’d paid good credits to excise the memories of his childhood orphanage.

“Just get me to the damned vault.” His grip tightened on the neuro-extractor strapped to his hip – a cold comfort in this sea of bittersweet nostalgia.  He was here for one thing only Comstock's son. The boy had vanished thirty years ago, swallowed by the labyrinthine alleys of Neo-Mumbai. Comstock had bought and sold entire memories since then – constellations of joy, terror, even love – to stave off the ache. But this one, the moment he’d learned his son was alive after all these years...that memory hadn’t been listed on any exchange. It was raw, uncommodified grief turned into something akin to hope - a precious anomaly that had to be extracted before it faded with Comstock's failing heart.
The vault door slid open with an almost inaudible sigh, revealing not rows of gleaming cartridges as Vin expected, but a chamber bathed in a soft violet luminescence. It pulsed like a beating heart, a luminous sphere suspended in the center radiating waves of sensation rather than light.

"That's it," chirped the hologram, its saccharine tone grating on Vin’s nerves. "The Resonance Chamber.  Mr. Comstock chose the most aesthetically pleasing containment for his… chosen memory." It gestured vaguely at the pulsating sphere with a hand that was just a little too expressive, too eager to please.

Vin stepped cautiously into the chamber, feeling a prickle of unease. He wasn’t a stranger to emotion-infused memories – he'd built a career on skimming them from unsuspecting clients. But this felt different. The air thrummed with a tangible weight of grief, hope, and something akin to despair. It wasn’t just the residual impression; it was as if the very chamber breathed with the memory itself.  He could practically smell ozone mixed with the metallic tang of blood – the scent of a desperate search party in monsoon-soaked alleys.

"The Resonance Chamber enhances transfer," the hologram explained, oblivious to Vin's growing discomfort. "It aligns neural patterns for a more… visceral experience." It tilted its head, as if considering this.  “Mr. Comstock insisted on it.”

Vin gripped his extractor tighter. He knew from the files that Comstock had been through a dozen extraction specialists before landing on him. Most hadn't even made it past the initial handshake, overwhelmed by the sheer potency of the locked memory. That was why they called these memories "Soul Slicers."  He’d heard stories; whispers in the smoky backrooms of Memory Row about how some memories weren't just experiences – they were woven into the very fabric of who you were.

As he approached the pulsating sphere, a jolt ran up his arm and straight through his chest. He staggered, hand flying to his heart where a phantom ache pulsed like a drumbeat. The orphanage.  It wasn’t the fire itself that had been locked away – it was the smell of scorched wood and singed wool, the terror clinging to his little brother’s pale hand as they tumbled from the second-story window.

The vault chamber hummed louder, resonating with a shared pulse of fear and loss.
The chamber thrummed with a life of its own, the violet light intensifying as Vin's hand trembled above the Resonance Sphere.  He stared into its swirling depths – an abyss reflecting not just Comstock’s grief but some primal ache within himself he hadn’t dared name in years. The orphanage fire wasn’t just smoke and screams; it was the bone-deep certainty that someone had loved him enough to keep searching, even after the flames had taken everything else.

He squeezed his eyes shut against a wave of nausea. It wasn't the extraction itself he feared –  he could handle those bursts of sensory overload like a seasoned junkie. This felt different. More visceral. He saw the faint outlines of his younger self in the sphere’s depths, huddled by the window with the soot-streaked face of a boy who'd lost everything. But then…a flicker of something else.  A man holding out a hand, bathed in the harsh glare of searchlights, calling out a name that tasted like hope and ash – Silas.

Comstock’s son.

The chamber pulsed with urgency, pulling him forward like an anchor to the seafloor. His fingers tightened around his extractor; it was cold against his clammy skin. The vault door shimmered as if struggling to contain the force of Comstock's emotion flooding into the room.  He had to choose surrender to the resonance, risk being swallowed by this maelstrom of grief and yearning, or let Comstock slip away. Let Silas remain a ghost in the ether.
Silas's face swam into focus within the sphere, young, hopeful, framed against a backdrop of frantic activity. Then, as if sensing Vin’s hesitation, the image shifted Julian Comstock was there too, older now, his features etched with grief, but holding Silas tight in a hug that radiated pure, incandescent joy.

A wave of bone-deep ache washed over Vin, stronger than any memory cocktail he'd ever encountered. It wasn't just Julian’s longing; it was the phantom warmth of another pair of arms around him,  the scent of woodsmoke and old wool mingled with something akin to relief. His brother Terry.

The image in the sphere dissolved for a heartbeat before solidifying again – this time, it was Silas’ face contorted with confusion, reaching out towards an empty space as if searching for someone who had vanished too quickly.

Vin squeezed his eyes shut against the sudden onslaught of sensory overload. He saw Terry again -  eyes wide with terror as flames licked at their escape route, clutching at Vin's hand with a desperate strength that surprised him even now. The fire, not a roaring inferno but a suffocating wave of heat and acrid smoke that choked him from the inside out, stealing his breath before it stole Terry’s life.

He had paid good credits to have those memories boxed away, locked in their safekeeping. But the chamber was pulling at them now, demanding he acknowledge the void they left behind. He hadn't just lost a brother; he’d lost the possibility of a shared memory, a moment of recognition, a chance to be found in the aftermath.

He opened his eyes again. The sphere pulsed with an almost unbearable intensity, but it wasn't Comstock’s grief that held him captive anymore – it was Silas's yearning, the echo of hope that still clung to him even after all these years.  He wouldn’t be able to touch that. Not without drowning.

Vin lowered his extractor. The vault chamber hummed with a resigned disappointment, its light dimming slightly. He didn't have time for soul-searching today. “Let me know if Comstock has any other memories worth extracting,” he said flatly to the hologram, already backing toward the door.
