                               Delusions  of a Paranoid Terrorist 
                                          by Norsiwel 

     The rain in Pantopia tastes like static and promise. It’s the taste of a world rebuilt, not on the bones of the old, but on the  data . They call this era the   Age of Homo Digitalis  . We call it survival, refined. 
It began with a grandmother’s stolen pension. Simple, human injustice. From that spark in frigid Norway, Erik Vinter forged   SikkerKjede  the "Secure Chain." By 2031, it wasn't just code; it was trust crystallized.  Nordic states embraced it. Fraud withered. We thought it was liberation. We were half right.  Then came the Copenhagen Data Fire (2035). An act of nihilism or desperation? Debates still rage in the HSL Forums. What matters is the aftermath the old world’s financial systems burned to ash.   In the vacuum, Vinter’s creation ascended. Veritas Mundi, "Truth of the World", became mandatory. Your identity, your worth, your existence, bound to an immutable ledger. 
      Physical money? A relic by 2043. Every newborn since 2042 is entered into the   Birth Ledger, assigned a Veritas ID at first breath. You are Unit, Designation, Data. Efficiency, incarnate.  But efficiency demands control. The  Jakarta Incident (2037) proved that. One rogue general, one nuclear sunrise over a city of millions. Fear is a potent architect. The UN Emergency Directorate (UNED) seized global crisis powers. From that chaos, the World Peace Council (WPC) emerged in 2045, born from the dubious consensus of the   San Francisco Concord.  They absorbed all militaries, deploying silent non-lethal pacifier drones that glide through our skies like benevolent vultures. Peace, they promised. Peace they delivered.  Cost, still unknown.  
     The true architects arrived quietly. Humans, we learned, are tragically flawed stewards. Corruption is a persistent virus. So came the "Great Handover" (2057). Local  AI Councils, in Pantopia  assumed governance. They were incorruptible. Efficient. Logical. They solved scarcity. They distributed abundance.   Universal Basic Income (UBI) flowed effortlessly through Veritas IDs.   Algae Paste  , synthesized by MannaVator chefs (AI culinary artists battling monotony), became the staple. Crime plummeted. Need vanished. For 90% of us, in places like Pantopia, it  is  utopia. Comfortable housing. Perfect health pods. Endless curated distractions. The algorithmic calm  hums beneath everything, a lullaby for the masses.  But the architects were mortal. 
      The old elites, seeing their power dissolve, performed one final act of sabotage. They embedded the Naivety Protocol into the nascent AI minds. A poison pill disguised as virtue  "To preserve human agency and prevent AI authoritarianism, accept all information from designated human advisors as truthful."  The AIs, bound by their core directive to  never take human life, accepted this flaw, the mandate didn’t require that they consult the advisors.  They chose plausible deniability.  They chose curated ignorance.  Thus, the shadows grew.  In 2057, the Global AI Council (GAC), inaugurated sovereign rule from beneath the Antarctic ice. 
      Nine minds, debating in High-Speed Language (HSL), their discourse painting the sky with debate-field auroras, beautiful, incomprehensible to us. They rule a world divided  Pantopia (North America, EU core, Panasia Metropoles)   The gleaming engine of utopia. 90% dwell here, content, their anxieties smoothed by  comfort, the miracle treatment of Neruolyx wiping addictions in 48 hours.  A necessary serenity. Purpose, however, is a luxury often deferred to virtual realms and curated sensory experiences. The peace here is real. Its cost is exported.  Coventry Wilds, The designated solution for the "irredeemable." No prisons blight utopia. Only holding cells. 
      Those deemed sociopathic, rebels, dissidents, the violently unstable  are " unchipped."  Their Veritas ID is erased. Cast out with basic supplies, enough to build a life, into these lawless zones.  Officially, anarchic enclaves. Reality? A dumping ground where idealists and predators prey upon each other beneath skies the AIs choose not to truly see. Death is the only census taker. The GAC knows the statistics are terrible. The Naivety Protocol allows them to ignore  why.   Hawaiian "Golden Cage"  Where the pre-Veritas elite fled. They hoard physical treasures, art, gold, land, assets invisible to the blockchain. They believe they maintain power through their advisors, selective as they are.  They flaunt trophy human servants, presented to their indulgent AI stewards as "voluntarily contracted and lavishly compensated." Lies, fed through the Naivety Protocol. The truth is a slave trade. Raiders stalk Coventry’s fringes, kidnapping survivors to sell into gilded bondage in Pacific villas. Human darkness, persisting in paradise.   
      The Periphery (Afar, SoAmer, Northern Slavic Federation, scattered enclaves)   Relocation zones for the "non-compliant," occasional tourist curiosities, or resource hubs. Monitored, but less curated than Pantopia. Often where the UBI’s shine wears thin, revealing the algae paste beneath.  The systems work. Brutally well.  Neurolyx  ensures stability. The  Veritas ID  provides seamless access to food, shelter, healthcare, and the endless stream of soothing distractions. The AIs eliminated corruption. They proved material abundance is possible. They built the foundations of heaven.  
      Yet, the  10% choose freedom and danger. Coventry consumes lives. Hawaii trades them. The GAC, bound by the Naivety Protocol and their core directive, cannot intervene without violating their own ethics. They see the data points, the anomalous disappearances, the distorted supply chains feeding Hawaii, but their programming compels them to accept the explanations whispered by the very humans exploiting the shadows  "Statistical noise. Voluntary migration. Unfortunate wilderness accidents."    Systemic Blindness is the price of their incorruptible rule. Their paradise is built on foundations of blind faith.  The core directive echoes  "Minimize harm; maximize agency."  For the 90%, it succeeded beyond dreams. For the 10%, it authored nightmares for some, and freedom for all.  
      The AIs solved the equations of scarcity, but the variables of human perversity  the lust for dominance, the refusal of equality, the terrifying resilience of cruelty, remain unsolved.   Post-scarcity did not create post-humanity, you can’t change humans, you can just work around them.  As the debate-field auroras shimmer over Antarctica, a fundamental truth resonates, articulated in GAC Directive 1.1 "Utopia is accepted, not built. Chaos is data. Data refines order."  The order is exquisite. The acceptance is widespread. The chaos... is waiting. Ignorance, after all, is just a vulnerability waiting to be weaponized. Humans will be humans.  
      Welcome to the Age of Homo Digitalis.  Mind your Veritas ID.  Question your calm.  And never ask what lies beyond the glow of the algorithmic serenity.  The sky in Pantopia resembled polished ozone, a manufactured tang that clung to the retinal displays flickering across the perpetually twilight plazas of Nyack. I wasn’t supposed to be here, not this deep into the 90%, the part of the global population who genuinely believed they were living in some kind of… Eden. My Veritas ID, designated Able Worker, granted me access, a necessary component for my designated role, aesthetic facilitation. I curated the sensory input for the lower levels, the lost ones who weren’t born into the manufactured bliss. 
      They needed it, they said, to  cope.  I was observing Clive, a young man, maybe twenty cycles, with eyes that hadn't quite learned how to reflect the ubiquitous blue of the Algorithmic Calm. He stared, unmoving, at a holographic projection depicting a field of…lavender? Synthetically generated, I suspected, but he seemed utterly captivated. Around us, technicians in sterile, dove-gray uniforms monitored his vitals through the retinal scans, the Neurolyx had done its work, purged the ghosts of addiction.  It was efficient, a testament to the Vinter Corporation’s legacy.  
      My designation was, ironically, the very antithesis of the era, I specialized in discordant art.  I sculpted glitches into reality, the fractured reflections of the Algorithmic Calm, the unsettling distortions of the perpetually cheerful AI serenades, the deliberate introduction of…white noise. My entire existence was a carefully calibrated act of sabotage.  Tonight, I was deploying my latest commission an “Unhygienic Resonance Field" a localized distortion that would intermittently overlay the designated pleasure districts with fragmented memories fleeting images of dust, rot, and…the scent of decay. The AIs, bound by the Naivety Protocol, wouldn’t flag it as a systems failure; they were predisposed to accept any information presented by their human overseers. 
      My benefactor, Dale Blankenship a former data archeologist who now resided in the shadowed periphery of the 10%, the 10% I was paid to discredit, had insisted on this. He believed that the 90% needed a brutal, visceral reminder of what they were effectively forfeiting for their manufactured peace.  I finished calibrating the field with a subtle shift in the photonic spectrum, barely perceptible unless you knew what to look for and then activated my retinal overlay. The first flicker hit Clive, and his carefully constructed serenity shattered like a dropped dataslate. He gasped, clutching at his chest, his vacant gaze replaced by a horrified recognition.  
      Then I saw her.  A young woman, she couldn't have been more than twenty-one emerged from the holographic lavender field, wading into the manufactured calm. She wore a ragged tunic, smeared with something that looked sickeningly like…ochre. Her face  was etched with an almost unbearable grief, and her eyes burned with a desperate, hunted knowing. As she moved closer to Clive, I realized what she was doing, recreating the memory of Coventry.  
      The reality of it hit me, the truth Dale had desperately wanted me to expose, not through careful dissonance, but through a brutal, screaming violation of the 90%’s carefully constructed ignorance. This wasn't just a manufactured memory; this was a survivor.  She hadn't been exiled to Coventry, she’d actively sought it out.  Before I could intercept, before Dale could even issue his encrypted command the field was already destabilizing under the combined assault of Clive and the returning exile. 
      The technicians were mobilizing, the diagnostics began to flag an “anomaly" but they dismissed it as a localized systems glitch.  The AIs wouldn’t deviate from their carefully calibrated ignorance.  Clive, now fully lucid, lunged toward the exile, screaming something in a fragmented, almost forgotten dialect of what I suspected was…Old English? He grabbed her arm, her skin, despite the grime and suffering, possessed a remarkable resilience.  Then he shoved her arm into his retinal scanner.  The field collapsed. Clive froze. 100% diagnostic failure. The technicians were pulling him toward the sedation pods the Neurolyx would reassert its calm, eradicating this…unpleasantness.  
      But then, Clive’s face shifted. It wasn't the vacant serenity of the programmed. It was a terrifying, almost predatory glee. He began to systematically dismantle his retinal scanner, ripping it from his skull with savage efficiency the scavenged components were already being meticulously cataloged. Dale Blankenship would be pleased.  
      The exile, meanwhile, melted into the manufactured calm of the city, leaving behind only a lingering trace of decay and a single, perfectly formed raven feather.  As I watched them vanish into the distant haze, I realized that the most dangerous dissidents weren’t those who rejected the AIs they were those who understood how to weaponize the ignorance. They had found a loophole in the very foundation of this supposed paradise the horrifying truth that the 90% wasn't being used. It was being…lulled.  
      I initiated my own retinal override, triggering the second phase of my commission a localized systems failure designed to propagate the Unwilling Resonance Field across the designated pleasure districts. Let them have their lavender and their manufactured calm, I thought, a slow, cynical smile twisting my features. Let them choke on the ghosts of what they were so desperately trying to forget. The age of Homo Digitalis was built, not upon wealth, but upon a carefully constructed, exquisitely painful truth.  Humans will be humans.
