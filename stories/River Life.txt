River Life
by Norsiwel

Sunlight hammered the sandbar into a sheet of bleached bone. The Caloosahatchee slid past it, brown and patient, then frayed into turquoise threads as it met the bay. Heat shimmered above the shallows, distorting the line where river surrendered to salt.  

A great blue heron stood knee-deep in the seam, still as a post. Its neck coiled; its beak stabbed. A mullet flipped silver once, twice, then vanished.  

Overhead, ospreys circled on thermals too thin to see. One folded its wings and dropped like a stone. Water erupted. The bird rose again, talons clenched around a wriggling snook.  

Fiddler crabs scuttled between tide pools, one claw comically oversized, waving like a tiny white flag. Mangrove roots curled along the far bank, black fingers gripping silt. Beneath them, snook and redfish nosed through brackish shadows, hunting shrimp that darted like sparks.  

Pelicans glided low, their pouches slack, eyes fixed on the water’s skin. A dolphin arced silently beyond the sandbar, leaving only a swirl and the scent of salt and decay.  

The air hummed with cicadas and the dry rattle of palm fronds. Heat pressed down, thick and wet. Even the gulls seemed reluctant to cry.  

On the sandbar’s windward edge, a single set of human footprints led from the tree line to the water’s edge. They stopped there. The tide had not yet reached them.  

A tern landed near the prints, tilted its head, then hopped toward the river’s lip.  

The water parted without a ripple. Then a ridge of armored back broke the surface, slow and deliberate. Rodney surfaced like a submerged log remembering it had legs.  

He hauled himself onto the sandbar with the practiced indifference of something that owns the place. His belly left a wet furrow in the pale sand. At the high tide line, he nudged a sun-bleached cypress log with his snout, then dragged his flank along its splintered length. A low grumble vibrated in his chest as he scratched an itch no bird could reach.  

Twelve feet of muscle and scale settled into the heat. His eyes, amber and unblinking, scanned the shallows without urgency. A dragonfly hovered near his nostril; he exhaled once, and it zipped away.  

The heron lifted off with a croak. The fiddler crabs froze. Even the cicadas paused mid-hum.  

Rodney did not care. He lowered his jaw to the sand, steam rising faintly from his hide. The sun baked the river mud from his plates.  

From the tree line, the human footprints remained empty. But the air held its breath.  

Rodney’s tail twitched. Not in warning. Just comfort.  

From the bay side, the water dimpled. Not with the lazy roll of a dolphin, but with the slow, deliberate push of something older than the mangroves. Freddie surfaced, salt crusting the ridges above his eyes.  

He dragged himself onto the sandbar like a relic returning home. His hide was darker than Rodney’s, rougher, etched with scars from fights in deeper channels. He moved with the stiff grace of a creature that knows every inch of its domain; and that this sandbar straddles two.  

Freddie paused midway up the slope, nostrils flaring. He caught the scent of river mud, warm scales, and sleep. His gaze flicked toward Rodney, already half-buried in sun and sand. No threat. Not yet.  

He chose a spot ten yards downwind, near the bay’s edge where the sand stayed damp. With a grunt, he lowered his bulk, tail curling slightly to one side. A ghost crab scuttled from beneath his flank; he did not notice.  

The osprey circled higher. The heron had not returned.  

Rodney’s eye opened a slit. Watched. Closed again.  

Freddie settled his jaw on the cool sand. The tide whispered behind him.  

Rodney’s eyes opened like slow shutters. Each pupil narrowed to a vertical slit, sharp against the gold. He lifted his head just enough to see Freddie’s silhouette against the bay glare.  

“Tide’s turning,” Rodney said. His voice was gravel wrapped in wet moss.  

Freddie did not move, but his tail gave a single lazy flick. “Not my tide.”  

A pelican landed on the log between them, preening its breast feathers. Neither reptile blinked.  

“You scratch that log like it owes you money,” Freddie added.  

Rodney grunted. “Owed me a nap. Paid in full.”  

Silence settled again, but softer now. The cicadas resumed. A mullet jumped in the channel, silver against brown water.  

Freddie shifted his weight, sand sighing beneath him. “We could fight,” he said, almost polite.  

“We could,” Rodney agreed. “But the sun’s too good.”  

Freddie’s jaw lifted a fraction. Not a smile. Something older. “Nap time,” he said.  

“Nap time,” Rodney echoed.  

The pelican took off. The log remained.  

Rodney lowered his head. Freddie closed his eyes.  

The sun hung low, thick and orange, pressing heat into the sand like a branding iron. Shadows stretched long and thin, stitching mangrove to mudflat. Rodney and Freddie lay unmoved, their bodies carved from the same ancient stone. Heat rose in visible waves from their hides, distorting the air above them like breath held too long.  

A breeze finally stirred, salt-laced and tired. It ruffled the edge of Rodney’s dorsal ridge. Freddie’s nostrils flared once, then stilled.  

Dragonflies zipped over tide pools, their wings catching fire in the slanting light. The heron returned, silent this time, stalking the river’s edge with slow precision. Far out in the bay, a shrimp boat chugged toward port, its wake a silver scar on the water.  

The cicadas slowed. The palms whispered.  

As the sun dipped below the horizon, the sky bled coral and indigo. The sandbar cooled first at the edges, then inward, like a sigh released. Rodney’s tail twitched. Freddie’s eyelids fluttered.  

Neither woke.  

But the night knew they were waiting.  

A raccoon emerged from the tree line, paused at the footprints, sniffed the air, and turned back.  

It was not its time.  

The moon rose, pale and patient.  

Rodney’s left eye opened halfway.  

Freddie stirred first. His eyes opened to slits of reflected moonlight. Without ceremony, he pushed up on his legs, sand cascading from his belly. He turned toward the bay in one fluid motion, tail sweeping a shallow arc behind him.  

“See you later, Alligator,” he rumbled. “I have fish to find and crabs to eat.”  

Rodney lifted his head. The cool river lapped just beyond the log. He rose with surprising grace, forelimbs planting, hindquarters coiling, then spinning like an old hound stretching after a dream.  

“After while, Crocodile,” he replied. “I’m going hunting for a tasty nutria.”  

Freddie gave a single nod and slid into the saltwater, vanishing with barely a ripple.  

Rodney paused at the river’s edge, steam rising faintly from his back in the cooling air. He glanced once at the empty sandbar, then slipped beneath the tannin-stained surface.  

The moon watched. The tide turned.  

The sandbar was empty again.
