                              The Clown
                             by Norsiwel


In summer of 1967,Barnum & Bailey Circus,the greatest show on earth,came to town. I was seventeen when a temp agency got me day work with the circus,putting up tents. When their gas-powered stake driver broke down and we needed the commissary tent up fast, I suggested something I'd seen on PBS the night before - three men on a stake with sledgehammers. It worked. The old-timers nodded approval,and suddenly I had a summer job living in an old bread truck, traveling with the circus. We laborers worked alongside the elephants but never handled them directly. There was a strict hierarchy performers in their world, us in ours. I always figured they had it made until I heard that shot echo from behind the big top

The air hung thick and sweet with popcorn scent; a chaotic symphony of
hawkers’ shouts and children's shrieks buzzed over the hushed anticipatory
murmur rippling through the dense mass of bodies crammed into the enormous
canvas tent.  Roughly woven fabric stretched taut above, filtering the
afternoon sun into splintered beams that slanted onto dusty sawdust scattered
liberally across the worn planks forming the uneven floor. A kaleidoscope of
colors exploded from every corner; scarlet and gold-trimmed costumes blurred
past, a blur of gaudy hats perched atop heads both wide and narrow. The pungent
aroma of elephant dung mingled with the cloying sweetness of cotton candy as
the crowd shifted restlessly on benches crafted from weathered wood and faded
velvet.

Suddenly, silence descended like a tangible thing; the murmur swallowed by a
wave of expectant hush that rippled through the crowd. A lone spotlight sliced
through the kaleidoscope of color pinning it onto a small platform raised high
above the sawdust floor.  There, beneath a single incandescent bulb, stood a
figure garishly costumed in a mismatched patchwork ensemble. A bright yellow
wig atop his head defied gravity, its improbable curls springing wildly from
every angle as if alive and independent.  His oversized shoes slapped softly
against the wooden boards with each exaggerated step, a rhythmic counterpoint
to the hushed anticipation.

The clown bowed; a sweeping gesture that culminated in a ludicrous split
accompanied by the ripping sound of his trousers splitting at the seams. A
ripple of startled laughter ran through the crowd as he scrambled back upright,
one hand frantically attempting to cover the offending tear while his other
continued the exaggerated bow. He paused for a beat, a gap filled only with the
rustle of fabric and the faint creak of strained wood, before pulling a scarlet
scarf from somewhere beneath his voluminous sleeves; whipping it around his
head in a dizzying spiral that sent strands of yellow hair flying like startled
bees.

The act was a whirlwind of slapstick: juggling rubber chickens that
inexplicably exploded with each catch, balancing precariously on an oversized
ball while simultaneously devouring a plate piled high with sugar-spun treats.
He tripped over unseen obstacles conjured seemingly from the very air around
him, sending spray bottles of water into the faces of unsuspecting children in
the front rows. Each pratfall was punctuated by a burst of manic laughter that
seemed to tear through his chest like paper crackling under a bonfire's heat.

And then, just as abruptly as it began, it ended. He took a final bow; this one
a grand, theatrical affair culminating with an impossibly deep curtsy, his
knees buckling beneath him and sending the bright yellow wig flying into the
air where it hung for a moment suspended in the spotlight before tumbling onto
the sawdust below. The clown retrieved his crown of unruly curls, tucked it
under his arm like a sleeping child, and exited through the right-hand doorway
leading to the backstage chaos, leaving behind only the lingering scent of
popcorn and the low murmur of the crowd gathering itself back into restless
life.
The heavy canvas flap slapped shut behind him, muffling the raucous laughter
still clinging to the air like stale smoke. He moved with a sluggish grace that
belied his performance’s manic energy; each step measured and deliberate
across the rough wooden floor of the cramped tent.  A single naked bulb dangled
from a rope knotted high above, casting harsh shadows that stretched long and
distorted across the cluttered space.

He stood before a chipped dressing table perched precariously atop three wobbly
legs, its surface scarred with years of spilled greasepaint and forgotten
lunches. The scent of stale talc mingled with the damp, earthy smell of old
leather; a cloying perfume unique to this backstage purgatory where dreams
clung stubbornly to sweat and dust.

He reached for a chipped porcelain basin sitting like a watchful eye on a stack
of moth-eaten velvet cushions. It was filled not with water as he’d hoped but
with lukewarm, tepid tea that smelled faintly of cloves and last night’s
dinner; the remnants of another clown's hurried morning ritual. He sighed; a
sound caught somewhere between a weary groan and the squeak of rusty hinges,
before plunging his hands into the lukewarm brew.

The cotton balls lay nestled in a chipped enamel tray beside him, their
pristine white stark against the murky brown of the tea-stained basin.  He
picked one up with his calloused thumb and dipped it into the tepid liquid;
watching as it soaked through, becoming a pale sponge clinging to his
fingertips.

His gaze drifted towards the worn oval mirror set into the dresser’s face.
The reflection staring back wasn't the painted caricature he’d just shed for
an audience hungry for smiles; but the man beneath – etched with lines that
spoke of seasons too many and weariness settling deep in the hollows under his
eyes.  He pressed the damp cotton ball to his cheekbone, rubbing slowly,
painstakingly.

The vibrant scarlet of the clown's makeup yielded with each gentle stroke;
dissolving into a dusty smear like a wound beginning to weep. The white beneath
wasn’t quite the stark canvas he expected. It bore faint traces of the life
lived under layers of laughter and greasepaint – the pale lavender bruise
blooming across his temple from an errant juggling pin, the stubborn smudge of
blue around his left eye that spoke of too many mornings spent staring into the
unforgiving glare of dawn.

The scent of oranges and lemon oil lingered faintly on his fingertips even as
the bright paint yielded to the touch; a phantom trace of childhood joy
clinging desperately to something more akin to weary resignation.  He continued
working; meticulously erasing the painted grin, revealing the thin curve of his
own lips beneath.

The flap rattled again, admitting not the dusty afternoon sun but a shaft of
vibrant emerald light filtering through the gaudy green velvet curtain that
served as the entrance to the tent's backstage area. It parted to reveal a
vision in shimmering crimson silk – skintight and low-cut, it clung like
liquid fire to her figure, every inch accentuated by sequins sprinkled with the
glitter of a thousand dying stars.

She moved with the fluid grace of a jungle cat, pausing just inside the doorway
before taking two confident strides across the uneven floorboards that creaked
underfoot in protest. Her scarlet lips curled into a practiced smile – not
quite reaching the cool emerald gleam of her eyes – as she perched gracefully
on the edge of the worn velvet cushion next to him. The scent of jasmine and
something sharper, like cardamom and clove oil, followed in her wake; a perfume
layered over the stale air of sweat and sawdust.

"How's it hanging, Bob?" she drawled without bothering with even a cursory nod
of acknowledgment. Her voice was husky and low, the kind that promised both
pleasure and trouble wrapped in equal measure.

He didn’t look up from his task; continued patiently swabbing away the
remnants of rouge from beneath one eyebrow. A faint, almost imperceptible
tremor ran through his hand. He didn't need to glance at her to know she was
eyeing him with a critical eye – those emerald eyes were never quite idle,
always taking in the world like a hungry cat savoring its prey.

The cotton ball came away leaving behind only a ghostly smudge of crimson. The
man beneath the painted smile looked up then; his gaze meeting hers across the
chipped enamel tray. For a moment, their gazes locked – a silent battle waged
under the harsh glare of the single bare bulb hanging above them.

Then she let out a soft sigh, the sound like wind chimes tinkling in a sudden
breeze. It wasn't quite pity that flickered across those sharp emerald eyes;
more like amused indulgence at some minor inconvenience. She reached for her
own tray – a chipped porcelain dish piled high with cotton balls and smelling
faintly of lavender talcum powder – and plucked one from the top.

Her movements were deliberate, precise, almost surgical as she began removing
her makeup. The crimson blush that had painted her cheeks in vibrant stripes
melted away under the touch of her fingertips, leaving behind the palest peach
hue. It was a stark contrast to the vibrant scarlet of her costume – a
jarring dissonance between the flamboyant mask and the fragile skin beneath.

He watched, as usual, while he worked on his own face -  a silent contract
established years ago in this shared space; two performers separated by worlds
yet tethered by the unspoken language of backstage rituals.
Lila’s sigh echoed through the tiny tent like a wind chime struck by an
unseen hand.  He couldn't see her face under the heavy drapes of crimson silk
that framed it but knew exactly what kind of smile she was offering - not quite
amused, not quite pitying, just a touch too knowing for comfort. He finished
removing the last vestiges of painted grin with a tired sigh, letting the damp
cotton ball drop into the chipped basin with a soft plop.  It echoed in the
silence that settled between them, a sound as hollow and brittle as his own
bones felt these days.

“Getting to old for this business, Lila,” he muttered more to himself than
to her. It wasn’t a question; not anymore. He stood then, stiffly at first,
like an old puppet relearning its joints after years of forced repose. A dull
ache pulsed in the back of his knees, protesting the sudden exertion.

Lila finally looked up from her own reflection – eyes gleaming with that
unsettling mixture of emerald fire and amber light as if she’d been peering
into a hidden chamber within his soul. “Don't tell me you're retiring on us,
Bob.” She tipped her head back, letting out a low, throaty laugh that rumbled
through the space like distant thunder.

He ignored it; turned his back on her and headed for the door without another
glance. He didn’t need to see the expression flitting across her face –
couldn't quite place it: amusement? Disbelief? Perhaps just a touch of
something akin to respect, carefully concealed beneath that practiced mask of
indifference.

The air outside the tent was thick with the humid breath of summer, heavy and
sweet with the scent of hay and manure mingling unpleasantly with the lingering
tang of cotton candy and popcorn. He breathed it in deeply, savoring its
familiarity; a primal reminder that he was still anchored to this world, this
circus that felt like both his cage and his only home.

His trailer - a battered metal box perched precariously on cinder blocks at the
edge of the teeming throng – offered a brief haven from the clamor. The door
creaked open with reluctant resistance, revealing its usual interior chaos:
discarded costume pieces strewn haphazardly over dusty canvas folding chairs, a
dented enamel basin filled with lukewarm water and half-empty bottles of cheap
whiskey,  and a single bare bulb hanging from a frayed cord that cast harsh
shadows across the cramped space.

He shed his clown skin in a flurry of discarded fabric, each layer revealing
another worn stratum beneath; faded blue undershirt stretched taut over ribs
too prominent for comfort, the threadbare brown pants damp with perspiration
and clinging to the lean musculature he'd been blessed - or cursed - with since
boyhood. He reached for a plain cotton shirt hanging limply from a rusty hook
on the wall –  a garment as ordinary as the man beneath it - and pulled it
over his head, leaving the stage persona behind in a heap of rainbow-colored
wreckage.

He ran a hand through his thinning hair, tugging at the unruly strands that
refused to settle into any semblance of order. The reflection staring back from
the dusty mirror hanging crookedly on the wall was a man weary and worn; not
quite a ghost, but certainly closer to one than he’d care to admit.  He
looked older in those brief moments stripped bare of paint and artifice, the
years etched deeper into the lines around his eyes and mouth. The faint tremor
in his hands returned as he leaned against the peeling paint of the counter,
staring out at the kaleidoscope of light and shadow spilling from beneath the
canvas tent flap.

He needed to think. Needed a moment before he faced that emerald-eyed gaze
again, needed a plan for navigating the next act;  a plan beyond simply
surviving until the final curtain fell.
The dented tin cup rattled against the counter as he set it down, its rim still
damp with condensation. It had been a good bottle – a splurge from a week’s
takings -  and the amber liquid flowed down his throat, leaving a familiar
warmth spreading through his chest like embers coaxed to life in a dying fire.

He leaned back against the chipped enamel countertop, eyes closed for a moment;
savoring the burn of cheap whiskey and letting it chase away the lingering
scent of sawdust and greasepaint clinging stubbornly to his skin. The clamor of
the circus outside seemed muffled through the thin canvas walls – distant
music merging with the cries of children and the rhythmic thumping of hooves on
packed earth.  A single, high-pitched shriek pierced through the haze of sound,
followed by a wave of delighted laughter that rippled outwards like pebbles
tossed into a still pond.

He opened his eyes then;  a slow deliberate movement. His gaze fell upon the
battered metal box tucked beneath the counter; its chipped paint and rusty
hinges worn smooth from years of use. He reached out, fingers brushing against
the cool metal, before pulling it open with a practiced ease born of
familiarity.

Inside, nestled on a bed of faded velvet lining, lay a silver revolver –  its
stock polished to a dull gleam by countless hands that had grasped it in
moments of reflection and repose. The worn leather grip felt reassuringly solid
beneath his fingertips; its familiar contours anchoring him to something
tangible amidst the swirling chaos of emotions churning within.

He lifted the gun gently, feeling the weight settle comfortably against his
palm. It wasn't a heavy weapon -  but the weight it carried was immeasurable.
He brought it up slowly then, a deliberate, practiced movement as if he were
reaching for an invisible star nestled just behind his temple. The barrel
rested lightly against his skin; cool metal kissing warm flesh.

He closed his eyes, inhaling deeply. The scent of whiskey mingled with the
earthy smell of sawdust and something else -  the faintest trace of gunpowder
that clung to him like a whispered promise.

The silence outside the tent was broken only by the distant thrumming of an
unseen drum, echoing softly through the canvas walls like a heartbeat fading
into stillness. He waited a moment;  breathing deeply until the rhythm of his
own pulse seemed to match that rhythmic murmur. Then, with a single sigh that
seemed to carry the weight of a thousand untold stories, he squeezed the
trigger.

The world outside remained vibrant - alive –  unaware of the silence that had
descended within the battered metal walls of the trailer. The music swelled and
faded; laughter echoed and died away. But for Bob, there was only a gentle
stillness now, like a curtain falling softly on the final act of a performance
that had run its course.
