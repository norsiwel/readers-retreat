 Hope & Heavy Debt (Cody Durham's Log)

That bank… my own damn dream staring back at me, laughing. Sleek curves, spires clawing at the Neotropolis smog, doors guarded by guys dressed fancier than my whole life savings. Even in my best threads, I felt like gutter scrap next to their gilded armor.

Inside? Pure intimidation. Monitors plastered every wall, stock quotes and star names – Aldebaran, Tarazed,  Earth  – flashing by faster than I could blink. Felt like those old sci-fi flicks that fueled my dockworker daydreams, reduced now to ticker symbols on a loan shark’s screen.

The loan officer was a balding pit viper in a suit worth more than Hope would be. He slid across a mountain of legal nightmares. The pen felt like lead, but it glided smooth, frictionless, as I initialed my life away, page after cursed page. Distant stars weren't realms of wonder anymore; just collateral. Aldebaran? Collateral. Earth? Collateral. My soul? Probably collateral too.

He flipped pages like a machine. "Sign here. And here." Pointing. Efficient. Cold. Only cracked a real smile when he dropped the bomb. "One million credits," he grinned, like it was a birthday present. "Repayable in one year. Daily interest? Point-eight percent." My stomach did a zero-g flip.

Signing that final page… Felt like sealing a pact with Destiny herself, and she drives a hard bargain. Cody Durham, dreamer? Dead. Meet Cody Durham, indentured spacer, launching on wings of borrowed credits, leaving Neotropolis’s neon canyons choking in my metaphorical dust.

   

Stepping out of that bank, the elevator was so smooth I didn't even feel it move. But the grin splitting my face? That was real. The borrowed million, the legalese shackles, that insane daily interest… it all suddenly  clicked . This crazy adventure was happening. I  was  leaving Prime. Stars, here I come.

The shipyard hit me like a hug – grease, ozone, rocket fuel. Home. Rusty hulks sat next to gleaming new beasts. My eyes scanned price tags like a hawk. Sleek racers whispered promises of speed, but their price tags screamed bankruptcy. My gut pulled me towards practicality. Something sturdy. Affordable. My ticket out without drowning in debt before I even left orbit.

Then I saw her. The Betelgeuse heavy shuttle. An updated classic. Not the fastest, not the flashiest, but  solid . More cargo space. More room for passengers or maybe a small crew someday. Her lines were clean, her hull catching the Prime sun just right. Reputable pedigree. Practical. Like me.

"I'll take it," I told the rep, the words heavy with every credit I didn't have and every dream I did. Paperwork signed. She was mine.  Hope . The name just… fit. Whispered it as I slapped the plate on her hull. Years of dock grime, sweat, and staring at the night sky – all poured into that one word. She gleamed. My metal-and-dreams ticket out.

   

Guiding  Hope  towards the Prime spaceport, I choked. Piles of… things. Giant, slimy-looking leeches littering the docks. "What in the seven hells?" I asked a sweaty dockhand wrestling one onto a cart.

"Ionic leeches," he grunted, wiping his brow. "Interstellar vermin. Infested the northern passage since before humans got here. Nasty. Latch onto your hull, suck the power dry. Rare, but we've seen swarms lately."

My grip tightened on the controls. "Precautions?"

"Watch your hull like a hawk. Deal with 'em fast if they latch. Shielding? Some swear by it, others call it credit-burn." Great. Just what I needed. Cosmic parasites. The adventure was already throwing curveballs.

Prime’s spaceport buzzed. Ocean world out there, over a billion people, and the whole place ran on Betelgeuse Shipyards. My first stop: outfitters. Funds were bleeding fast after buying  Hope , but I needed a map. Snagged the local star chart for 1000 credits. Seeing those routes flicker to life on the holo… that felt real. My path.

Trade center next. Electronics were dirt cheap here! Seemed too good. With a sigh, I plunged most of my remaining credits into 35 tons of the stuff. Hold full, account weeping, but… opportunity. Maybe. Still had room for passengers, but the job board was dead for electronics runs. Fine. Serpens in Phact was calling. Market research said electronics sold well there.

Three jumps to Phact. Mostly quiet. Saw a blip once – maybe pirates tangling with someone else.  Hope  wasn't packing heat. I kept my nose clean and my warp drive engaged. No heroics today, just survival.

Emerging at Pearl… wow. Spaceport on an island, dug into a mountainside. Quarantine measures, they said. Keep the space rats out. Efficient. Beautiful in a stark way. Sold the electronics fast and turned a decent profit! Scanned the board. Two passengers to Serpens for 9.5K? Modest, but Serpens needed equipment… which was pricey here. Needed freight to fill the hold. Clothing! Short supply here, decent demand on Serpens. Bought a hold full. Passengers boarded. Profit margins looked tight but workable.

   

Leaving Pearl? Peace shattered. A beat-up pirate tub popped out behind us, lasers flashing before I could jump! Shields held, thank the void. Klaxons screamed. I threw  Hope  into evasive maneuvers, heart pounding like a warp core breach. That little scrapheap was agile! Finally… the jump drive engaged. We surged into the warp tunnel, leaving the pirate spitting cosmic dust. Lesson learned: space isn't just pretty stars.

Serpens. Ancient canyons, baking deserts. Spaceport was a mesa top cleared flat, surrounded by adobe huts. Lab coats mixed with snake wranglers on horseback. Smelled like antiseptic and manure. Unique. Sold the clothing. Profit was… okay. Passengers paid. Checked the bank. Still owed a soul-crushing 896,000 credits on  Hope . Stopped at the local bank. Made an extra payment. Felt good, chipping away at that mountain. Lessened the weekly bleed. Freedom felt… slightly closer.

Next job popped up: Four passengers to Featherweight in Mebsuta. 24,000 credits. Needed the creds, but Mebsuta had a rough rep. Pirates. Featherweight demanded heavy metal, raw steel. Raw steel was reasonably priced here. Filled the hold. Risk vs. reward. Let's do it.

Three jumps to Mebsuta. Saw Navy ships scrapping with pirates way off in the distance. No trouble for us. Arrived at the jump point. Now the  long  sub-light haul to Featherweight.  Hope ’s no racer. Nervously watched the fuel gauge and the scanner. Please, no trouble…

Featherweight. Low gravity. Weird place. Ceilings too high, locals towering like slender giants. Spaceport felt… unwelcoming. No shops, just a few food carts. Village miles away. Paid my passengers their 24.5K. Relief. Felt like an alien visiting an alien world. Found a job fast: 27 tons of zinc to Splashdown in Canopus. Only two jumps back towards known space. Accepted. Needed freight  out . Plastic! Demand on Splashdown, decent price here. Bought 8 tons. Account down to 366K. Hoped Splashdown would be kind.

Trip was quiet. Just me and the hum of the engines. Splashdown… aging marshes and rice paddies. Spaceport high on a plateau. Grain silos, warehouses, a BBQ joint with outdoor seats. Simple. Sold the plastic. Score! Got a  great  price. Account up to 359K. Then… opportunity knocked. Woman in a suit. "Deliver these papers to relatives on Bluestone, Bellatrix system. By Dec 18th. 100,000 credits." I didn't hesitate. Didn't even check the map. "Done."

Reality hit  after  I said yes. Checked my charts. Bluestone was  way  outside my mapped area. Blind jump. No idea about markets, demands… couldn't even buy a map here! No outfitter. Panic fluttered. Blind gamble time. Passenger board empty. Deadline looming. Industrial supplies were cheap here. Grabbed a hold full. Prayed I'd find fuel, prayed I'd find a market. Set the coordinates. Engaged the drive. Jumped into the absolute unknown.

   

First jump… binary star system. Beautiful, terrifying. Scanned desperately. Found a gas giant. Fuel low. Took the risk, dove into the soup.  Hope  rattled like a tin can, but the scoops gulped down enough hydrogen. Relief tasted like recycled air. Next jump. More nothing. Asteroid fields. Uncharted weirdness. Flying blind, trading blind. Sold the industrial supplies for a surprisingly okay price on some moon outpost. Kept the creds flowing, barely.

The Dec 18th deadline was a drumbeat in my skull. Final jump into Bellatrix… planets! Spotted Bluestone. Landed on rocky, cliff-faced terrain. Found the relatives. Handed over the papers. Saw the grief, the gratitude. The 100K hit my account. Sweet, sweet relief. I’d gambled blind and won.

Standing there, breathing Bluestone’s thin air, I felt it. Not free yet – still 796K hanging over  Hope  – but lighter. Stronger. The galaxy wasn't just stars and debt; it was opportunity, risk, and sometimes, blind luck. My log’s getting long. Time to find the next job. Aldebaran’s calling, apparently. Medical supplies. Big payout. Maybe… just maybe… the end of this debt is in sight. Cody Durham, signing off. For now.
