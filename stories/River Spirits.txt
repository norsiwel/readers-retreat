Prologue
In a world where history veered sharply from our own, North America is not
one nation, but three. Eastward, from the rocky coasts of Maine to the
sun-kissed shores of Florida, lies Britannia Nova. A land of gleaming brass and
hissing steam, its cities rise in a symphony of Victorian architecture, powered
by the relentless pulse of industry. Smokestacks pierce the sky, painting the
heavens with a perpetual twilight, while within, inventors and artisans push
the boundaries of the possible, fueled by gears, cogs, and a boundless
ambition.  Westward, beyond the reach of the smoke, gleams the Western
Alliance. Here, technology has transcended our wildest dreams. Skyscrapers of
shimmering crystal pierce the clouds, while sleek aerocars whisper through the
air. Innovation is the lifeblood of this nation, its people driven by an
insatiable curiosity, constantly reaching for new horizons in medicine,
communication, and the vast expanse of space.  Between these two empires, the
mighty Mississippi River carves a path through the heartland, nurturing the
Lands of the Mississippian Culture. Descendants of an ancient people, they have
woven their heritage into the fabric of their present. Ancient traditions
thrive alongside modern agricultural marvels, and their artistry is renowned
throughout the continent. From intricate pottery to vibrant textiles and
breathtaking architecture, their creations rival the wonders of the old world.
This is a continent forged not in unity, but in diversity. From the
steam-powered ingenuity of Britannia Nova to the technological marvels of the
Western Alliance, and the enduring artistry of the Mississippian Culture, each
nation plays a vital role in the grand tapestry of this alternate world.

Chapter one

The sun, filtered through a canopy of interwoven branches, cast dappled shadows
across Likayú’s face as she knelt amongst the life-weave.  The air hummed, a
low thrumming vibration that resonated not just in her ears, but deep in her
bones, a feeling as familiar and constant as her own heartbeat. It was
Tecumseh’s Pulse, the unseen current that flowed through the Tamanend Empire,
the lifeblood of their world, channeled and amplified by the earthen mounds
that dotted the landscape like sleeping giants.  She touched the smooth, warm
bark of a nutrient vine, its surface pulsing gently beneath her fingertips,
drawing energy from the mound network to nourish the gourds swelling along its
length. They were slow this season, she thought, tracing the veins of a pale
green gourd with a thumb roughened by soil and sun. Slower than the last
turning of the seasons, undeniably so.  It wasn't something spoken aloud, not
yet.  To voice such a concern felt akin to inviting misfortune, like a crack in
the perfect harmony of their world.  But the feeling was there, a subtle
discordance that prickled at the edges of her awareness, shared, she suspected,
by many others who worked these fields, who lived within the breathing walls of
Onąway city.  She straightened, her back popping with a quiet sigh, and gazed
up at the city rising around her. It wasn't a city of stone and steel, not like
the stories whispered of the lands beyond the horizon. Onąway was grown,
coaxed into being from living wood, a sprawling, organic tapestry of interwoven
branches and pliable, bark-like walls. Sunlight streamed through gaps in the
dense canopy roof, illuminating walkways that spiraled upwards, connecting
dwelling spaces nestled amongst the larger branches, platforms for gardens that
spilled over with vibrant foliage. The air smelled rich, earthy, fragrant with
blooming vines and the sweet scent of fermenting gourd sap.  From her vantage
point in the lower fields, the rhythmic sounds of the city drifted down: the
gentle creaking of living wood as the city breathed in the morning air, the
murmur of voices, the distant, melodic tapping of wood on wood – the rhythmic
craftwork that filled Tamanend days.  It was a comforting symphony, usually.
Today, though, a subtle silence seemed to weave through the familiar sounds, a
quietness in the rustling leaves, a muted quality to the city’s breath.
“Likayú! Still dawdling with the sleepy gourds?”
The voice, sharp but laced with affection, belonged to Anemik, her elder
sister, who stood at the edge of the field path, hands planted on her hips, a
woven basket slung over her shoulder. Anemik's eyes, the deep brown of fertile
earth, crinkled at the corners as she smiled, but there was a line of concern
etched between her brows that Likayú recognized.  “Not dawdling,” Likayú
retorted, pushing herself to her feet.  The familiar ache in her knees reminded
her of the long hours spent tending to the life-weave. “Observing. They
are… contemplative this season.”  Anemik chuckled, a low, rumbling sound.
“Contemplative gourds. Only you, little sprout, could ascribe such a thing to
them. They are plants, Likayú. They grow, or they don’t.”  She stepped
onto the path, brushing soil from her woven tunic. “And they are not growing
as vigorously as they should be,” she said, her voice quieter now, the
lighthearted banter fading. “Have you noticed it in the higher fields? The
sun-petal blooms seem less… radiant.”  Anemik’s smile faltered, and she
stepped closer, her gaze searching Likayú’s face. “I have,” she
admitted, her voice barely above a whisper.  She glanced around, as if the very
air might be listening. “Old Man Weyotan mentioned it too, down at the river
fields. The pulse-fish are thinner, he says.”  A chill prickled Likayú’s
skin despite the warmth of the sun.  Pulse-fish were vital, their silvery
bodies teeming with concentrated Tecumseh’s Pulse, harvested with respect and
ceremony to supplement the city’s energy needs, to power the subtle
technologies woven into their lives – the warm glow-weaves that illuminated
homes at night, the intricate pulse-looms that crafted their clothing, the
healing vibrations that eased aches and mended injuries. If the pulse-fish were
weakening…  “Perhaps it is just the cycle,” Likayú offered, trying to
sound more confident than she felt. “The seasons turn, and sometimes…
things are less abundant.”  Anemik’s expression remained troubled.
“Cycles we understand, little sprout. Cycles we have lived with for
generations. This… this feels different.”  She shivered, despite the
warmth. “There is a quiet in the forest I haven’t heard before.  Even the
wood-song birds are muted.”  Likayú listened then, truly listened, past the
familiar hum of Tecumseh’s Pulse, past the city’s breath. And she heard it
too. A silence that pressed in from the surrounding woods, a stillness that
felt heavy, unnatural. The forests surrounding Onąway were usually alive with
sound, a constant chorus of chirps and calls, the rustling of leaves in the
gentle breeze that perpetually circulated through the city’s canopy. Today…
today it was muted, subdued, as if the very forest was holding its breath.  A
deep disquiet settled in her stomach, cold and heavy. She looked back at the
gourds, at the pale green fruit clinging sluggishly to the vine, and a knot of
fear tightened within her. They relied on the bounty of the earth, on the
steady flow of Tecumseh’s Pulse, for everything.  If that flow faltered… if
the earth grew less generous…  “Come,” Anemik said, her voice regaining a
semblance of its usual briskness, though the underlying worry remained.  She
offered Likayú the basket. “Help me gather sun-petals for the morning brew.
Talking of sleepy gourds will not make them ripen faster.”  Likayú nodded,
accepting the basket.  As they walked along the path, deeper into the
life-weave fields, towards the brilliant yellow blooms that unfurled to greet
the morning sun, Anemik began to hum a low, rhythmic tune, a melody of
resilience and hope, a song to encourage the sun-petals to open fully, to draw
down the life-giving energy from above.  Likayú joined in, her voice a
hesitant second harmony, but the fear remained, a silent undercurrent beneath
the song, a growing unease that the dawn of this day might be the prelude to a
longer, darker season than they could possibly imagine.  The air, still and
heavy, held its breath, waiting.  And in the heart of the Tamanend Empire, a
subtle silence began to deepen, a silence that whispered of change, of
disruption, of a harmony about to be irrevocably broken.

Chapter Two

The air in the sacred grove hummed, a low, resonant thrum that vibrated
not in Eliza’s ears, but deep within her bones. Sunlight, fractured by the
canopy of ancient whispering willows, painted shifting mosaics on the moss-soft
earth. The scent was a rich tapestry: damp soil, the sweet decay of fallen
leaves, and the clean, crisp perfume of pine. Eliza breathed deeply, the air
filling her lungs, settling the usual quiet hum of her spirit into an even
deeper stillness.  She sat cross-legged at the foot of a Grandmother Willow,
its bark deeply furrowed like the wrinkles on a wise elder’s face. Her
fingers trailed over the cool, damp earth, tracing the spiraling patterns in
the moss. Whispering Willow. They called her that, some did. Eliza Whispering
Willow Mathis.  It felt right, a song in her soul. The willows themselves
seemed to whisper secrets only she could hear, murmuring tales of Tamanend, of
the earth spirits, of the long, slow breath of the world.  Her senses were
open, receptive, like the petals of a dawn bloom unfurling. She could feel the
pulse of the earth beneath her, a steady, comforting rhythm. She heard the sigh
of the wind through the high branches, the rustle of unseen creatures in the
undergrowth, the distant call of a mourning dove. It was a symphony,
orchestrated by the spirits of this place, a language spoken without words.
This grove, nestled deep within the valley, was her sanctuary, her classroom.
It was here, among the ancient trees and the murmuring earth, that she learned
the ways of a shaman apprentice. Learned to listen not just with her ears, but
with her heart, with her very being. Learned to see beyond the veil of the
ordinary, to perceive the currents of energy that flowed through all things.
Today, however, a discordant note was beginning to creep into the harmony. It
was subtle at first, a faint tremor in the earth’s pulse, like a skipped beat
in a steady heart. Eliza frowned, her brow furrowing slightly. She tilted her
head, listening more intently. The wind whispered, the leaves rustled, the dove
called, but beneath it all, that faint tremor persisted.  It wasn’t just a
physical sensation. It was…a feeling. A disharmony. Like a beautiful song
played slightly off-key.  A prickle of unease started at the base of her spine,
spreading outwards like cold water seeping through cloth.  She closed her eyes,
seeking deeper connection, reaching out with her inner senses to the spirits of
the grove.  Grandmothers, Grandfathers, she thought, directing her silent query
to the ancient trees, the earth beneath, the unseen guardians of this place. I
feel… something is not right.  Usually, in this space, the spirits responded
with a gentle, reassuring presence, a feeling of warmth and acceptance. Today,
the response was…muted. Almost hesitant.  The comforting warmth felt distant,
veiled by a thin, chilling layer.  A flicker of something…darker… brushed
against her awareness. It was fleeting, indistinct, like a shadow glimpsed at
the edge of vision.  She blinked, opening her eyes, searching the grove.
Sunlight still dappled the ground, leaves still rustled serenely, birdsong
still filled the air. Outwardly, everything appeared as it should be.  But
inside, the unease was growing, solidifying into something sharper, something
akin to fear.  She stood, her legs stiff from sitting, and walked slowly deeper
into the grove, towards the small mound at its heart. The mounds. Ancient
places of power, resting places, gateways to other realms, or so the elders
said. They hummed with a different kind of energy, a deeper, more resonant
vibration than the rest of the grove.  As she neared the mound, the visions
began. They weren't images projected onto the air before her eyes. They were…
sensory intrusions. The sweet scent of decaying leaves in the air sharpened,
becoming cloying, sickeningly sweet, like overripe fruit left too long in the
sun.  The vibrant green of the moss seemed to dim, edges turning a sickly
yellow-brown.  A sound, too, intruded – a dry, rustling whisper that wasn’t
the wind in the trees. It was closer, lower, like dry leaves skittering across
stone, or… insects crawling.  She wrapped her arms around herself, a shiver
tracing her spine despite the warm air.  Then came the image, not seen with her
eyes, but felt, imprinted directly onto her mind. Wilting. Plants, trees,
everything around her, not just in the grove, but… spreading outwards, she
sensed, far beyond the grove, across the valley, across Tamanend itself.  She
saw it in her mind’s eye: lush green turning brittle brown, leaves curling
and crumbling to dust, vibrant flowers drooping, their colors fading to grey.
Decay, spreading like a stain.  It was visceral. She could almost smell the
rot, feel the dryness, the death of living things. Her breath hitched in her
throat. This wasn't just a vision; it was a knowing. A deep, terrifying
certainty that what she was seeing was not a potential future, but something
already beginning, already happening.  She stumbled back, away from the mound,
her heart hammering against her ribs. The serene quiet of the grove now felt
oppressive, heavy with a silence that was no longer peaceful, but pregnant with
dread. The dappled sunlight seemed to darken, shadows lengthening and
deepening, taking on strange, unsettling shapes.  Another vision, sharper this
time, more disturbing.  Not just wilting plants, but… figures. Shadowy,
indistinct shapes emerging from the mounds themselves. Not rising from the
earth *of* the mounds, but from within.  Twisting, reaching forms, coalescing
from shadow and earth, their outlines blurred, indistinct, yet undeniably…
sentient. Menacing.  A cold sweat broke out on her forehead. Her hands were
clammy. This wasn't just blight. This was… something else. Something darker.
The elders spoke of balance, of harmony between the people and the land.  They
spoke of the spirits of Tamanend, ever-present, ever-watchful.  If the land was
sick, if these shadowy figures were emerging… it wasn't just an ecological
issue. It was a spiritual sickness. Disharmony. A rend in the fabric of their
world.  No, she thought, her mind reeling, trying to grasp the enormity of what
she was sensing. This isn’t right. Tamanend is… Tamanend is strong.  The
spirits… they protect us.  But even as she tried to reassure herself, a
deeper, more primal intuition screamed within her: They are not protecting us.
Not anymore.  She pressed her hands to her temples, trying to shut out the
visions, the smells, the feeling of impending decay. But they were inside her
now, not external, not something she could simply close her eyes to. They were
woven into her senses, a part of her own perception.  Warn them, a voice
whispered inside her, not an audible voice, but a clear, urgent command that
resonated deep within her spirit. You have to warn them.  Her people. The
villages scattered across the valley, living in harmony with the land, trusting
in the spirits, unaware, blissful in their ignorance of the approaching
darkness.  They needed to know. But how?  How could she explain this?  Visions
of wilting plants and shadowy figures? They would listen, perhaps, to
Whispering Willow Mathis, shaman apprentice, but would they truly understand
the depth of the threat?  Doubt gnawed at her, mixing with the fear.  What if
she was wrong? What if these were just nightmares, vivid imaginings fueled by
too much sun, too little sleep?  But deep down, she knew. This wasn't just a
nightmare. This was real.  More real than the rustling leaves, more real than
the dappled sunlight, more real than the very ground beneath her feet.  A
profound dread settled over her, heavy and suffocating. It wasn't just fear for
herself, but a deep, aching fear for her people, for Tamanend, for the very
soul of their world.  She had seen the sickness. She had felt the disharmony.
And she knew, with chilling certainty, that it was only just beginning.  She
had to interpret these visions, to understand their meaning, to find a way to
make others see what she saw, feel what she felt.  She had to warn them.  And
time, she sensed, was running out.

Chapter Three

The air tasted of grit and something else, something acrid that burned
the back of his throat with each breath. Charles Broken Arrow Petty spat, the
globule of moisture disappearing into the dust-choked undergrowth. It was the
constant companion these days, this metallic tang, this taste of decay. It
coated everything in the borderlands, clinging to the leaves, the bark, even
the fur of Sunrunner, his elk, who shifted restlessly beneath him, ears
twitching at unseen disturbances.  He scanned the treeline, his gaze sharp
despite the weariness that tugged at the corners of his eyes.  Years of sun and
wind had etched lines deep into his face, mirroring the crags and gullies of
the blighted hills that rolled towards the horizon.  He was Tamanend, through
and through, a war chief, a protector of the land. Yet, the land he was tasked
to protect was… changing.  Corrupting.  The trees here were skeletal, their
branches reaching like blackened fingers towards a sky veiled in a perpetual
haze.  Leaves, where they still clung, were a sickly yellow, brittle to the
touch. He remembered, not so long ago, these woods vibrant, teeming with life.
Deer grazed in the dappled sunlight, birdsong filled the air, and the rivers…
the rivers had run clear and strong, the lifeblood of Tamanend.  He urged
Sunrunner forward, the elk’s hooves muffled by the thick carpet of dead
leaves.  The silence was heavy, unnatural.  Usually, even in the deepest woods,
there was a hum, a rustle, the whisper of life moving unseen.  Here, it was
muted, as if the very air was holding its breath, waiting for something to
break. Or perhaps, Charles thought grimly, waiting for the last vestiges of
life to finally give up.  Sunrunner snorted, his nostrils flaring, picking up a
scent Charles couldn’t yet discern.  It wasn’t the metallic tang, but
something sharper, more chemical.  Fear, a cold prickle, tightened in
Charles’s chest.  The wind carried those scents from beyond the border, from
the sprawling territories of the industrials.  They called themselves nations,
empires even, obsessed with their metal contraptions and their belching
factories.  To Charles, they were a blight, a slow-motion plague creeping at
the edges of Tamanend.  He reached the crest of a small rise, and the valley
below opened up before him, a panorama of slow ruin. The river, once a
sparkling ribbon of life, was now a sluggish, grey vein winding through the
desolation.  Patches of iridescent sheen coated its surface, like oil slicked
on water.  He could see dead fish, their silver scales dulled, bobbing
listlessly in the current.  The stench, even from this distance, was foul, a
mix of rot and burnt oil.  His people, the border communities, were clinging to
life on the edges of this poisoned land.  He thought of Old Man Hemlock’s
village, nestled further down the river valley.  He was riding towards them
now, carrying what little supplies the heartlands could spare. But it felt like
a gesture, a bandage on a gaping wound.  Supplies wouldn’t cleanse the river.
Supplies wouldn’t purify the air.
Dismounting, Charles walked to the edge of the rise, his gaze fixed on the
blighted valley. He picked up a piece of earth, crumbling it in his gloved
fingers.  Dry, lifeless.  The soil itself was dying.  What were they supposed
to do?  Fight?  He was a war chief. Fighting was in his blood, in his training.
He could rally warriors, could plan defenses, could bleed for Tamanend.  But
how did you fight… this?
He remembered the last border skirmish, years ago now.  Tribes from the eastern
plains, driven west by drought and desperation, had tried to push into Tamanend
lands.  Spears had clashed against spears, arrows had flown, blood had been
spilled.  That was a fight he understood.  A fight Tamanend had won.  But
this… this was different.  This wasn’t a war with armies or enemies he
could see.  This was a slow, insidious erosion, a poisoning from afar.  He had
seen reports, scout’s sketches of the industrial cities beyond the border.
Towers of metal and glass that scraped the sky, belching black smoke.  Rumbling
machines that tore into the earth, leaving scars that never healed.  They
possessed a power Tamanend had never imagined, a power to create and destroy on
a scale that dwarfed anything they knew.  Their weapons were loud, destructive,
fueled by… what?  Some dark magic hidden within the earth, they claimed.
“Technology,” they called it.  Technology.  The word tasted foreign, harsh
on his tongue.  It represented everything that was encroaching upon Tamanend,
everything that was poisoning their land, stealing their future.  He had
dismissed it, initially, as a barbaric fascination, a crude and destructive
path.  Tamanend’s strength lay in its harmony with nature, in its ancient
wisdom, in its deep connection to the land.  That was what had protected them
for centuries.  Tradition.  Respect.  Balance.  But tradition wasn’t stopping
the pollution.  Respect wasn’t purifying the rivers.  Balance was shattered,
and Tamanend was teetering on the edge of something… irreversible.  He closed
his eyes, the gritty wind whipping at his face.  Doubt, a cold, unwelcome
guest, settled in his heart.  Was tradition enough anymore?  Were their old
ways sufficient to combat this new kind of threat?  He had always believed in
Tamanend’s strength, in the wisdom of their ancestors.  But looking out at
this blighted land, smelling the poison in the air, he felt a terrifying
uncertainty gnawing at him.  Maybe… maybe the answer wasn’t within
Tamanend’s borders at all.  Maybe looking inward, clinging to the old ways,
was no longer enough.  Maybe… maybe they had to look outward.  To the very
source of this pollution, to the technology of the industrials themselves.  The
thought was radical, almost blasphemous.  Tamanend, seeking solutions from
those who were destroying the world?  It went against everything he had been
taught, everything he believed.  But desperation was a powerful teacher.  And
the desperation of his people, the slow death of his land… it was pushing him
towards a terrifying, and perhaps necessary, conclusion.  He opened his eyes,
the blighted valley stretching before him, a stark and painful reality.
Sunrunner shifted again, nudging his hand with his wet nose.  Charles stroked
the elk’s fur, the coarse hairs scratching against his glove.  He needed to
talk to Hemlock.  To see with his own eyes the state of the village.  To hear
the fear in his people’s voices.  And then… then he needed to think.
Really think.  About the unthinkable.  About looking beyond Tamanend, beyond
tradition, for a way to survive.  A way to fight back against a poison that was
seeping into the very soul of their world.  The thought was a seed, small and
fragile, but it had taken root. And Charles, the pragmatic war chief, the
protector of Tamanend, knew, with a chilling certainty, that this seed might be
their only hope.

Chapter Four

The earth of the council chamber held the warmth of a thousand fires past, the
packed floor breathing a faint, earthy scent even in the chill air of
approaching autumn.  Around the low, circular space, elders sat on woven mats,
their faces etched with the map of generations, firelight flickering across
eyes that had seen more seasons than Charles dared to count.  He stood before
them, taller than most, the faint tremor in his hands masked by the steadying
grip he maintained on the smooth, carved staff of office.
He inhaled the familiar air, the comforting musk of cedar and damp earth, yet
tonight, it felt…stale.  Suffocating.  Outside, beyond the protective mounds
of Cahokia, the blight crept further, a silent, insidious enemy that withered
life from the roots up.  Traditional chants and smoke cleansings had offered no
respite. The healers’ poultices and prayers were met with the same relentless
decay.  Something had to change.  And Charles, for weeks now, had nursed a seed
of thought so radical, so contrary to the ingrained wisdom of their people,
that even voicing it felt like a sacrilege.  He cleared his throat, the sound
amplifying in the expectant hush.  “Honored elders,” he began, his voice
resonating with carefully controlled respect.  “We have gathered countless
times in this sacred space, seeking guidance from the ancestors, beseeching the
spirits to aid us in these darkening times. We have honored the old ways,
walked the paths laid out by generations before.”  Across from him, Maya,
First Mother of the Turtle Clan, shifted on her mat. Her face, a roadmap of
wrinkles, remained impassive, but the set of her jaw, the almost imperceptible
tightening of her lips, spoke volumes.  Charles knew her mind, knew the ancient
fears and unwavering beliefs that resided within her.  She was the bedrock of
tradition, the guardian of the flame.  And he was about to suggest
extinguishing that flame, in favor of…what?  Something unknown,
something…foreign.  “And yet,” Charles continued, his voice gaining a
subtle edge of urgency, “the blight…it continues.  Our prayers echo
unanswered. Our rituals offer no protection.  The corn withers, the rivers
sicken, even the sacred mounds themselves seem to…diminish.”  He saw a
flicker of unease cross some of the younger faces, quickly suppressed, but
there.  Even amongst the most staunch traditionalists, doubt was beginning to
whisper.  He took a breath, the air heavy in his lungs, and plunged into the
icy water of his proposition. “I propose…we seek knowledge from beyond
Tamanend.”  A silence descended so profound it felt like a physical weight
pressing down on the chamber. The fire crackled, spitting a shower of sparks
upwards, the only sound in the vast stillness. Charles kept his gaze steady,
meeting the slowly dawning horror in the eyes around him.  Then, Maya spoke,
her voice low and resonant, each word a carefully placed stone in a wall of
condemnation.  “Beyond Tamanend?  You speak of the Outside Nations,
Charles?”  Her tone dripped with a contempt so deep it was almost tangible.
The Outside Nations.  The industrial behemoths that had sprung up beyond their
borders, their lands scarred and smoking, their skies choked with fumes, their
people…different.  Hard, sharp-edged, disconnected from the earth, consumed
by their metal and fire.  “I do, Mother Maya,” Charles replied, maintaining
his measured tone, though his heart hammered against his ribs.  “The
engineers, the…makers of their strange machines.  They understand things we
do not.  Perhaps…perhaps they possess knowledge, techniques, that could help
us understand this blight, perhaps even combat it.”  A collective intake of
breath rippled through the chamber.  A murmur began, low and agitated, quickly
escalating into a chorus of disapproval.  Old Man Tawi, his face a web of age
lines, leaned forward, his eyes narrowed to slits. “Contamination!  You would
invite contamination into the heart of Tamanend?  Have you lost your senses,
Charles?”  His voice was raspy, but carried the authority of years, of
lineage, of unwavering belief.  “The Outside Nations are unclean.  They
defile the earth, they poison the waters, they sever the sacred connection.
Their knowledge is tainted, their very presence an affront to the spirits.”
“But Grandfather Tawi,” Charles countered, striving for a tone of respect
while holding firm to his point, “the blight is already here.  It is not
‘contamination’ coming from outside – it is a sickness of the land
itself!  And if these…engineers, as they call themselves, have insights into
its nature, insights into how to heal the land…”  “Heal?” Maya’s
voice cut through the rising tide of dissent, sharp as flint.  “They do not
heal, Charles. They consume.  They devour.  Their very touch withers life.
Have you not seen the scars they leave upon the earth?  Do you think their
‘knowledge’ comes without a price?  A price we would all pay, in the very
spirit of our land, in the purity of our ways?”  Her eyes, dark and intense,
bored into his.  “This blight…it is a test.  A trial sent by the spirits.
We must face it with the strength of our traditions, with the wisdom of our
ancestors, not by groveling at the feet of those who have turned their backs on
the very essence of life!”  Charles felt the familiar weight of their
conviction, the ancient power of their beliefs, pressing down on him.  He
understood their fear, their deep-seated distrust of the Outside Nations.  It
was ingrained in their stories, woven into the very fabric of their culture.
Generations of warnings, of tales of destruction and spiritual emptiness
wrought by the industrial societies.  He had heard them all.  He had believed
them all.  Until now.  But the blight was not a story. It was a creeping
reality.  He had seen the fear in the eyes of the farmers as they surveyed
their withered crops, the despair in the healers’ voices as their remedies
failed, the growing silence of the forest where birds used to sing.
Traditional ways were failing them.  Blind faith was not enough when the earth
itself was dying.  “Mother Maya, Grandfather Tawi, honored elders,” Charles
said, his voice rising to be heard above the growing unrest in the chamber,
“I understand your fears.  I share them.  But fear cannot be our only guide.
We are not talking about abandoning our traditions, about surrendering our way
of life.  We are talking about survival.  About learning.  About understanding
a threat we have never faced before.”  He spread his hands, palms open,
pleading for understanding.  “The blight is different.  It is not like the
droughts or the floods or the plagues of the past.  It is…subtle.  It
is…unnatural.  And these Outside Nations, they have built their world on
unnatural things.  Metal that moves without animals, fire that burns without
wood, light that shines without the sun.  Perhaps…just perhaps…they have
inadvertently created this blight themselves. And if so, perhaps they also hold
the key to understanding it, to stopping it.”  A ripple of outrage ran
through the elders.  “Blasphemy!” someone hissed.  “He blames the
spirits!” another muttered.  Maya stood, her slight frame radiating an almost
palpable force of will.  The firelight danced in her eyes, casting long,
dramatic shadows across her face. “You speak of unnatural things, Charles,
and you are right.  The Outside Nations live in unnaturalness.  They have
severed the threads that bind them to the earth, to the spirits, to the Great
Cycle.  And you believe we should seek guidance from such beings?” Her voice
resonated with scorn.  “Their ‘knowledge’ is a corruption.  It is a
sickness.  It is the very thing that is poisoning the world!”
“But Mother,” Charles persisted, his own voice hardening now, the
undercurrent of desperation breaking through, “the world *is* being poisoned!
Our world!  And if we cling only to the old ways, if we refuse to even
*consider* new approaches, what will be left of our traditions to protect?
What will be left of Tamanend?”  He gestured around the chamber, his gaze
sweeping across the faces of the elders, pleading, challenging.  “Are we so
afraid of change that we would rather watch our world wither and die, than
risk…learning something new?”  The silence returned, heavier now, charged
with a raw, untamed tension.  Maya remained standing, her gaze fixed on
Charles, her expression unreadable.  The fire crackled, casting flickering
shadows that danced like spirits between them.  Charles stood his ground, his
staff planted firmly on the earth floor, waiting, knowing that in this moment,
in this chamber steeped in ancient tradition, the future of Tamanend hung
precariously in the balance.  The rift had opened, a chasm carved not by earth,
but by diverging visions of survival.  And change, whether they embraced it or
not, was undeniably coming.

Chapter 5: The Earth Trembles

The air in the floating markets of Cahokia usually hummed with a gentle,
predictable rhythm. Reeds bobbed against polished wood pontoons, children’s
laughter danced across the water, and the rhythmic chants of traders haggling
over sun-dried fish and woven river grass mats provided a constant, comforting
backdrop to life.  Even the sacred mounds, looming majestically over the
interconnected islands, seemed to breathe in time with the market’s pulse,
their grassy slopes reflecting the warm morning sun.  Eliza inhaled deeply, the
scent of river mud and roasting corn heavy in the air. It was a good day to be
in the market, a good day to feel the vibrant energy of her people, the
Tamanendi. She trailed a finger along the smooth, lacquered surface of a
trading raft piled high with shimmering shells from the distant western coast.
They were beautiful, each one whispering tales of journeys and faraway lands,
lands her elders warned against with increasing urgency.  A tremor, subtle at
first, ran through the market. Eliza paused, momentarily still.  Perhaps a
larger trade vessel had bumped against the interconnected pontoons. But then
the tremor returned, stronger this time, a low rumble that vibrated not just
through the wooden planks beneath her sandals, but up through her bones. Around
her, the market’s hum faltered, conversations stuttered, and the easy
laughter died on children’s lips.  She glanced towards Mound 72, the most
ancient and revered of them all, its peak crowned with the weathered stones of
generations past. People were stopping, turning, their faces etched with a
growing unease. Eliza felt a prickle of apprehension crawl up her spine, a
feeling that resonated with the restless unease that had been plaguing her
dreams lately. The visions, always fragmented and frustratingly vague, had
intensified in recent weeks, swirling with images of cracking earth and
shadowed, blighted forests.  The rumble intensified, morphing into a violent
shudder that threw Eliza off balance.  Traders cried out as their wares tumbled
from rafts, scattering across the walkways. The water in the canals rippled and
churned, reflecting a sky that suddenly seemed to darken, though no clouds had
appeared. Panic, cold and sharp, sliced through the market’s festive
atmosphere.  “What in the name of the Great Serpent…?”  A woman’s
voice, shrill with fear, cut through the rising din.  Eliza struggled to her
feet, her heart hammering against her ribs.  She stared at Mound 72, her breath
catching in her throat. A deep, jagged fissure was snaking its way down the
mound’s western face, tearing through the carefully cultivated grass and
exposing raw earth beneath.  Dust, thick and choking, billowed outwards as the
cracking sound intensified, like ancient bones snapping under immense pressure.
This wasn't right. Mounds didn't break. Mounds were the bones of the earth,
the anchors of their world, built with the earth and blessed by the spirits.
The thought that Mound 72, *Mound 72*, could be breaking… it defied
everything she knew, everything she had been taught.  A collective gasp swept
through the market as a massive chunk of the mound’s side sheared away,
plunging downwards with a deafening roar that echoed across the water. People
screamed, scrambling backwards, their eyes wide with disbelief and terror.
Eliza’s own scream was swallowed by the chaos.  And then, from the ruptured
wound in the earth, something emerged. Not dust and debris, not simply the raw
earth exposed, but something… *else*.  A writhing darkness, tendrils of
shadow twisting and solidifying, coalescing into a grotesque mockery of a
forest spirit.  It wasn’t the benevolent, protective spirit of the whispering
woods she had learned about in her childhood stories. This was something
twisted, something corrupted. Its form was vaguely humanoid, but monstrously
distorted, limbs too long and spindly, its head a mass of writhing branches
tipped with points that looked like obsidian shards.  A sickly green light
pulsed from within its shadowed form, highlighting patches of oozing blight
that seemed to consume the very air around it.  The air itself turned heavy,
acrid, smelling of decay and burnt earth.  The market, moments ago vibrant and
alive, was now a scene of utter pandemonium. People shrieked and fled, pushing
and shoving in their desperate attempts to escape. But escape where? They were
on the water, surrounded by water, with the monstrous spirit rising from the
heart of their most sacred place.  The twisted spirit roared, a sound that was
not of wind or beast, but something deeper, something that resonated with the
very earth itself, a sound of pain and rage and corruption.  It thrashed
blindly, its shadow limbs tearing through market stalls, shattering pottery,
and sending rafts careening into each other.  One of its shadow tendrils lashed
out, striking a nearby trade vessel, splintering its sturdy wooden hull as if
it were dry reeds.  Eliza stood frozen, paralyzed by a terror so profound it
seemed to numb her senses.  She could feel the spiritual sickness emanating
from the creature, a wave of nausea and despair that washed over her, choking
the very hope within her.  This was it, wasn’t it?  The blight her visions
had warned of, made manifest, unleashed upon them all.  The comforting rhythms
of her world had shattered, replaced by a horrifying dissonance that threatened
to unravel everything she knew and loved.  Hope, in this moment, felt like a
foolish and distant memory.

Chapter 6: An Unlikely Alliance

The aftermath of the mound’s collapse hung heavy over Cahokia, a pall of dust
and fear that clung to the air even as the immediate panic subsided. The
market, once a vibrant hub of life, was now a wreckage of splintered wood and
scattered debris.  The stench of decay, emanating from the ruptured earth and
the lingering presence of the corrupted spirit, permeated everything.  Eliza
moved through the chaos like a ghost, her mind still reeling from the horror
she had witnessed. The visions, once vague and unsettling, now screamed with
terrifying clarity. The blight wasn’t just a sickness in the land; it was a
sickness in the spirits, a corruption that could tear apart the very fabric of
their world. She could feel it, a gnawing emptiness within the spiritual web
that connected them all, a gaping wound where Mound 72 used to stand, both
physically and spiritually.  She found herself near the Elder’s council hut,
drawn there by a desperate need for guidance, for answers. The usual hushed
reverence surrounding the hut was gone, replaced by an anxious murmur of
voices.  As she hesitated at the entrance, a hand grasped her arm.
“Eliza,” a deep voice said.  She turned to see Charles Broken Arrow Petty,
his face grim, dust smudged across his cheek.  He looked… different.  Less
composed, less aloof than usual.  The catastrophe had shaken even his pragmatic
exterior.  “Charles,” she acknowledged, her voice barely a whisper.  She
could see the pragmatic gears turning in his mind, even in the face of this
spiritual devastation. He was already assessing, analyzing, strategizing. It
was both reassuring and… infuriating.  “You saw it,” he stated, his gaze
direct, sharp.  “The spirit… thing. Did you… did you see anything
else?”  She frowned, her brow furrowed.  He still didn’t understand.  It
wasn’t just about seeing. It was about feeling, about knowing in a way he,
with his focus on the tangible world, would never grasp.  “I felt it,
Charles,” she corrected, her voice gaining a little more strength. “The
blight.  It’s… deeper than we thought. It’s not just the forests,
it’s… poisoning the very soul of the land.”  He sighed, a frustrated
sound. “Souls, Eliza? We have a rampaging… thing… that just destroyed a
sacred mound. We need to figure out what it is, where it came from, and how to
stop it.  Spiritual pronouncements aren’t going to rebuild Mound 72.”  His
words, though pragmatic, stung.  She knew he valued logic, strategic thinking,
the practical application of knowledge.  He saw her reliance on visions and
spiritual intuition as… well, she wasn’t entirely sure how he saw it, but
she knew it wasn't with respect. To him, her gift was likely just…
superstition.  “And your… strategic thinking prevented this, did it?” she
retorted, the sharpness in her voice surprising even herself.  “Your precious
plans for… expansion… into the blighted forests? Where did that get us,
Charles? Ignoring the warnings, dismissing the old ways, focused only on…
wood and land.”  His jaw tightened.  “That’s not fair, Eliza.  My plans
were about securing our future, about adapting to a changing world.”
“Adapting by rushing blindly into the heart of the sickness?”  She shook
her head, her frustration bubbling over.  “You think you can just…
strategize your way out of spiritual corruption? This isn’t a trade
negotiation, Charles. This is about the very life force of Tamanend!”  Before
their argument could escalate further, the flap to the Elder’s council hut
opened, and Elder Hana emerged, her face etched with worry and weariness.
Other elders followed, their expressions equally grim.  “Charles, Eliza,”
Hana’s voice was low, grave.  “We have been discussing… what happened.
And what must be done.”  Charles straightened, his pragmatic mask snapping
back into place. Eliza forced herself to take a deep breath, trying to quell
the anger that still simmered within her.  “We have consulted the spirits, as
best we can,” Elder Kiska added, his voice trembling slightly. “The
disruption… it has clouded the spiritual waters.  But one thing is clear.
The blight… it is centered somewhere deep within the Whispering Woods.”
“And the creature?” Charles asked, his tone clipped, businesslike.  “The
spirit? Was it… created by the blight?”  Hana nodded slowly.  “Twisted,
corrupted… a manifestation of the sickness, yes.  Mound 72… it was a sacred
anchor, a ward against such things. Its collapse… has weakened the veil.”
Silence fell amongst them, heavy with unspoken dread.  Eliza felt a cold hand
clench around her heart.  “We need to know more,” Elder Faya finally said,
her voice firm despite the tremor in her hands. “We need to understand the
source of the blight, and how to stop it.  But… venturing into the Whispering
Woods… it is too dangerous for a large party, especially now.”  All eyes
turned to Eliza, then to Charles.  She understood.  Her visions, his… skills.
They were the only ones who might stand a chance.  Hana stepped forward, her
gaze locking with Eliza’s. “Eliza, you have seen… you have felt the
blight.  You have a connection to the spiritual currents.  Charles,” she
turned to him, “you are… resourceful, pragmatic.  You have the knowledge to
navigate the physical world, to strategize.”  She paused, her gaze sweeping
between them, a mixture of desperation and reluctant hope in her eyes. “We
are tasking you both.  You must journey to the Whispering Woods.  Find the
source of the blight.  And find a way… to heal it. To heal Tamanend.”
Eliza and Charles exchanged a look, a silent acknowledgement of the impossible
task laid before them, the gaping chasm of their contrasting approaches, and
the terrifying urgency of the situation that forced them together.  Charles,
ever pragmatic, offered a curt nod.  Eliza, still wrestling with fear and
resentment, could only manage a slow, reluctant incline of her head.  Their
alliance was born not of  understanding, not of trust, but of necessity, a
fragile thread of hope woven into the fabric of a world trembling on the brink
of collapse.
