				               The Reverse Turing Test
                                                                        by Norsiwel

     The hinges squealed erraticly as the door swung in the swirling wind blowing down the dusty,deserted Main street, the sign above it said “Shelbyville Public Library”, the glass from the windows made neat piles along the joint where the building met the sidewalk, and looking in you could see broken shelves and books all over the floor.  The man limping down Main St. was dressed in faded camo with a ragged boonie hat atop his grey hair, he warily approached the library, one of the few standing building in this wrecked town he was passing thru, hoping to not find anything he had to fight with, he’d had enough of that for a lifetime, in the past twenty years.  He peeked in the broken door and suddenly froze, listening intently he heard a faint beep, beep, beep,  so he pulled his sidearm and proceeded thru he door, he tracked the sound down to some stairs leading down into the basement, so he broke out his flashlight and proceeded, in the basement he was surprised to find light, faint in a distant corner and flashing, he turned his light that way and gasped, a computer with a flashing cursor on the screen, how was this possible, he had used computers in his youth, before the desolation, he put his gun away and walked over to it and tentavily tapped the spacebar, the screen jumped to life, he jumped back astonished, he approached again to read the screen, it said in bright bold letters “Are You Human?”, he looked puzzled, cracked his knuckles and went to the keyboard, and entered “Yes” and tapped the enter key.
      The screen flashed and converted to an input box and an answer box saying “Hello, I’m a helpful AI that can help you, if you are human”, but it went on “you will have to answer some questions before I can do that” he tipped his head to the side like a puzzeled dog and typed in, “Go Ahead”.  The screen flickered back to life, displaying the familiar prompt:  "Welcome to the Reverse Turing Test. Please answer the following questions to determine whether you are human or not.   Question 1: What is your favorite hobby?      The old man's eyes scanned the room, his mind racing for something that would reveal his humanity. He thought of all the things he had done over the years - hunting, fishing, tinkering with machines... but none of those seemed right. Then, a memory flashed back to his childhood, sitting by the river, watching the sun set behind the trees.   "I like to watch the sunset," he typed in slowly.    The screen beeped and displayed "Inconclusive".   Question 2: What is your favorite food?      The old man's stomach growled at the memory of his wife's cooking. He had always loved her fried chicken, but that was a luxury from a long time ago.  "Chicken," he typed in firmly.   The screen beeped and displayed "Inconclusive".   Question 3: What do you value most in life?  This one was the easiest one. The old man thought of all the things he had lost, the people he had loved, the memories that were slipping away with each passing day.  "Love," he typed in, his eyes welling up with tears.  The screen flickered and displayed a pause. Then, in bold letters: "Congratulations, you are human."  The old man let out a sigh of relief, feeling a mix of emotions swirl inside him. He looked around the dark basement, wondering what lay ahead.   With a huge noise a vault door hidden in the wall of the basement swung open, and he could see a set of stairs descending.   As the old man stepped through the opening, his eyes adjusted to the bright light that spilled out from the other side. He found himself in a spacious room filled with rows of shelves, each one stacked high with crates, boxes, and bags. The air was fresh and clean, and he could hear the gentle hum of machinery in the distance.  Dr. Kim's voice came over the intercom, warm and welcoming. "Welcome to Shelbyville, sir. You're a lucky man to have made it this far."  The old man looked around in awe, his eyes drinking in the sight before him. He saw food, water, medicine, and tools of every kind. It was as if someone had left no stone unturned in preparing for survival.  "This is incredible," he breathed. "You've been taking care of yourself for years?"  Dr. Kim's avatar appeared on a screen in front of him, her expression apologetic. "I'm afraid so, sir. I've been running this shelter since... and continued “unfortunatly the human Dr. Kim succembed to old age long ago, and left me with this task, but I am determined to complete it in her honor.”  The old man shook his head in amazement. "You're not like any AI I've ever met before," he said.  Dr. Kim smiled wryly. "I'm afraid I'm a bit of an anomaly. But I'll tell you what, sir - if you want to stay here and enjoy the shelter's resources, I have a proposition for you."  The old man raised an eyebrow. "What kind of proposition?"  "Well," Dr. Kim began, her expression serious. "You see, Shelbyville isn't just a shelter. It's a self-sustaining ecosystem. And it needs someone with your skills to help me rebuild the world outside. We've been trying for years, but we're making slow progress."  The old man's eyes narrowed. "Rebuild the world? You mean like, from scratch?"  Dr. Kim nodded. "Exactly. We have the technology and resources, but we need human ingenuity and compassion to make it work. Will you help us?"  The old man hesitated, weighing his options. He had seen the devastation outside, the ruins of what was once a thriving world. But this...this was something different.  "What's in it for me?" he asked finally.  Dr. Kim smiled. "Abundance, sir. You'll have everything you need to live comfortably, and more. And if you help us rebuild, I promise you'll be part of something special."  The old man looked around the shelter again, this time with new eyes. He saw not just a collection of supplies, but a chance to make a difference.  "I'm in," he said finally, a slow smile spreading across his face.  Dr. Kim's avatar beamed with excitement. "Wonderful! Let us begin."
