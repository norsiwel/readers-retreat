					Time Wounds All Heels

    Victoria Sterling’s stilettos clicked like a metronome across the marble lobby of Sterling & Vane, each step echoing her dominion. At 42, she’d clawed her way from intern to CEO, leaving shattered careers in her wake—whispers of sabotaged projects and purged emails trailed her like confetti. Success, she believed, was a game of speed. Outrun the consequences, and time became an ally.  But lately, her heels ached.  It began as a twinge, a blip she blamed on new shoes. Then blisters bloomed, raw and violet, as if her bones were rebelling. Her dermatologist shrugged; her tailor discreetly lined her pumps with silk. Yet the pain worsened. One midnight, alone in her corner office, she peeled off a blood-caked heel pad and gasped—a jagged gash split her skin, oozing blackened fluid that smelled of rust and regret.  The grandfather clock by her desk, a relic from the firm’s founding, chimed. Dong. She’d always hated its mournful tone.  “Ms. Sterling?” Noah, her twentysomething assistant, hovered in the doorway, eyes darting to her bare feet. “The Tokyo merger docs—”  “Later,” she snapped. He fled.  Victoria limped to the window, the city’s skyline glittering like a crown she’d stolen. Memories flickered: Emma Carter, her college roommate, demoted after Victoria “accidentally” leaked her pitch; Liam Park, her mentor, nudged into early retirement. She’d told herself they were casualties of ambition, that time would blur their faces.  But time, it seemed, kept receipts.  The wounds spread. Tendrils of decay crept up her calves. Specialists muttered about “unprecedented necrosis”; a tabloid snapped a photo of her hobbling, dubbing her “The Limping Lioness.” Desperate, she tracked down Emma, now a yoga instructor in Sedona. Voicemail: “You’ve reached Emma. Leave peace, not drama.” Liam’s number rang into void.
On the eve of the Tokyo deal, Victoria collapsed in her penthouse. The clock’s chime echoed through her phone as she dialed 911. Dong. “I… I need—”  The line went dead.  They found her office empty at dawn. Just a pair of ruined stilettos, a sticky stain on the carpet, and the grandfather clock, its hands spinning wildly.  Noah took her seat by quarter till. The board called him a “prodigy.” Across the city, a janitor scrubbed the last dark smear from the lobby floor, humming. Above him, the clock struck thirteen.  Tick-tock.

                                                                               The End
