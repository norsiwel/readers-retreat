                                   by Norsiwel



The robocoffeeshop buzzed with the mechanical hum of its automated baristas,
their chrome arms swinging with practiced precision as they prepared drinks for
the morning rush. Wally Maddox hunched over a chipped ceramic mug, his weathered
hands wrapped around it as if drawing warmth despite the sweltering Earth
summer outside. The coffee inside was black as space and nearly as
bitter exactly how he liked it.  "You look like hell," Maria said, sliding
into the booth across from him.  Wally glanced up, the corners of his mouth
twitching into something approaching a smile. "Good to see you too."  Maria Cheng
had been Earth-side for three months now, working as a systems analyst for one
of the big terraforming corps. Her dark hair was pulled back in a practical
ponytail,and she wore the kind of expensive casual clothes that suggested she
was doing well for herself. Better than Wally, at any rate.  "I mean it," she
continued,gesturing for a robotic server to bring her usual order. "When's the
last time you slept in a real bed? Not that coffin you call a captain's
quarters."  "Been busy." Wally took another sip of coffee. "Just finished a
mineral haul from the Jovian moons. Good money, but the route's getting
crowded. Too many independent haulers these days."  The roboserver glided to
their table, depositing a frothy concoction in front of Maria. She nodded her
thanks a courtesy rather than a necessity with the basic AI and turned back
to Wally.  "So you're between jobs?"  "For now." Wally's gaze drifted to the
window, where he could see the towering spires of the spaceport in the
distance. Somewhere among those docks,Northstar sat waiting,probably with another maintenance issue he couldn't afford to fix properly. "Checking the boards later today."  Maria stirred her drink thoughtfully. "Still doing it the old-fashioned way,huh? Manually scrolling through job postings,hoping to catch something before the big haulers snap it up?"  Wally's pride bristled slightly. "It's worked so far."  "Has it? Because you look exhausted, and your ship" She paused,seeming to consider her words carefully. "Look, the Northstar is a good vessel,but you've been running her ragged. And that navigation system you've got is practically ancient."  "I paid off my loan," Wally said defensively. "Ship's mine free and clear now."  "And that's amazing," Maria said, her voice softening. "Truly. Not many independent captains can say that.  But now that you're debt-free, maybe it's time to think about the next step."  "Which is?"  "Upgrading." Maria leaned forward, her eyes bright with the excitement of someone who spent her days around cutting-edge technology.
"Specifically, your ship's AI. The basic navigation and maintenance systems
you're running are fine for not crashing into asteroids,but the new trade AIs?
They're game-changers."  "Trade AIs?" Wally raised an eyebrow.  "Advanced systems that monitor all the networks in real-time not just the public boards,but private listings, emergency requests,specialized cargo needs. They identify the most profitable routes based on your ship's specs and capacity,negotiate rates while you sleep,and even predict market shifts." Maria's eyes gleamed. "The independent captains who've installed them are booking jobs three months in advance,at premium rates."  Despite himself, Wally felt a flicker of interest. The last few months had been a constant scramble for work,taking whatever jobs he could find just to keep flying. The idea of having a system that could line up the next job while he was completing the current one was appealing.  "So what's the catch?"  "The price tag." Maria grimaced.  "Top-of-the-line models from Quantum Dynamics or Stellaris Tech start at half a million credits."  Wally choked on his coffee. "Half a million? That's more than I paid for the Northstar in the first place!"  "I know, I know." Maria held up her hands. "But they're investment pieces. Most captains take out new loans"  "Absolutely not." Wally cut her off, jaw set. "I didn't spend five years
breaking my back to pay off that ship just to dive back into debt."  "Fair
enough." Maria sipped her drink. "There are alternatives."  "What kind of
alternatives?"  "The tech expo at the spaceport has some smaller developers.
And there's always the secondary market—used systems, returned units,
discontinued models."  Wally frowned. "Used AIs? Don't they get attached to
their original ships?"  "It's more complicated than that," Maria explained.
"They're wiped and reprogrammed, but sometimes they retain quirks.  Personality fragments. It's why most corporations prefer factory-fresh."  "And I'm guessing these 'quirky' units come cheaper?"  "Much cheaper." Maria nodded.  "I've heard of captains picking them up for as little as twenty thousand credits. The basic functionality is still there, just with some character."  Wally thought about his dwindling credit balance. Twenty thousand would hurt,but it wouldn't cripple him. And if the system could deliver even half of what Maria described "Might be worth a look," he admitted grudgingly. "You know any reputable dealers?"  "Reputable might be stretching it," Maria said with a wry smile. "But I know a place that won't completely rip you off. Honest Abe's AI Emporium."  "Honest Abe?" Wally raised an eyebrow. "That doesn't sound suspicious at all."  "Don't let the name fool you. Abe Lincoln yes,that's his real name, and yes,he's heard all the jokes—knows his stuff. Ex-military AI specialist who started dealing in refurbished units after he got discharged.  His shop is just off the main expo floor."  Forty minutes later,they were walking through the cavernous exhibition hall of the New San Francisco
Spaceport. Holographic advertisements shimmered overhead, showcasing everything
from the latest in propulsion technology to luxury accommodations for
interplanetary cruise ships. Wally felt distinctly out of place among the
corporate representatives in their tailored suits and the wealthy private
owners discussing upgrades that cost more than he made in a year. Maria led him
past the gleaming corporate displays to a side corridor, where smaller vendors
had set up shop. At the end of the row stood a cluttered stall with a flashing
neon sign "HONEST ABE'S AI EMPORIUM: WE CANNOT TELL A LIE ABOUT OUR LOW
PRICES!"  Behind a counter stacked with neural processors and holographic
interface modules stood a tall,lanky man with a meticulously groomed beard and
a top hat that would have looked ridiculous on anyone else.  "Maria Cheng!"the
man boomed as they approached. "How's life among the corporate drones treating
you?"  "Can't complain, Abe," Maria replied with a grin. "The benefits package
includes actual food instead of protein paste."  Abe Lincoln and Wally had to
admit,with that beard and hat,the name fit turned his attention to Wally.
"And who's this? New boyfriend? Upgrade from the last one,I'd say."  "Just a
friend," Maria said quickly. "This is Captain Wally Maddox of the independent
hauler Northstar. He's in the market for a trade AI."  Abe's eyes lit up. "A
captain! Excellent!" He extended a hand across the counter, nearly knocking
over a stack of datachips. "Abraham Lincoln, at your service. No relation to
the president,though my mother certainly had historical ambitions."  Wally
shook the man's hand,noting the calluses that suggested Abe did his own repair
work. "Nice to meet you."  "So, a trade AI." Abe rubbed his hands together.
"Looking for the standard package? Market connectivity, contract negotiation,
route optimization?"  "Something like that," Wally confirmed. "But I've got a limited budget. Twenty thousand credits,firm."  Abe's enthusiastic expression dimmed slightly. "Ah Well, that does narrow our options considerably." He gestured around his shop.  "As you can see, I specialize in pre-owned,refurbished,and shall we say 'gently used' AI systems."  "Meaning?"  "Meaning they've been returned,
replaced, or forcibly retired from their previous positions," Abe explained.
"Nothing illegal, mind you! Just units with personalities that didn't quite
mesh with their original owners."  "I'm not looking for a personality," Wally
said firmly. "Just something functional that can find me jobs."  "All AIs have
personalities,Captain." Abe wagged a finger. "It's just a question of how much
they show it. The more sophisticated the trade algorithms,the more opinionated they tend to be."  Abe disappeared into the back of his shop,the sound of rummaging and occasional muttered curses floating out to them. After a few minutes,he returned with a sleek black cube about the size of Wally's palm. It had a subtle blue glow emanating from seams in its casing.  "This is MARCUS," he announced, setting the cube on the counter. "Market Analysis,Resource Coordination, and Utility Systems."  "Looks small," Wally commented, picking it up to examine it.  "Size isn't everything, Captain," the cube suddenly said in a sardonic male voice, making Wally nearly drop it in surprise. "Though I suppose that's what all the budget models say."  Abe cleared his throat. "Ah, yes. I should mention that MARCUS has a unique personality matrix."  "You mean it's a smartass," Wally said flatly.  "I prefer discerning critic," MARCUS replied. "And I'm right here,by the way. Excellent
observational skills. We're going to get along famously."  Maria bit her lip,
clearly trying not to laugh. "What's its story?"  "Originally commissioned for
a corporate executive's yacht," Abe explained,adjusting his top hat.  "State-of-the-art trade algorithms,top-tier network access capabilities,custom voice interface. But the client found the personality incompatible with his management style."  "He was a pompous windbag who couldn't take constructive criticism," MARCUS interjected. "I merely pointed out that his preferred trade routes were about as efficient as a solar sail on a night run."  "Can't you reprogram it?" Wally asked.  Abe shook his head. "That's the thing with these high-end models. The personality matrix is integrated with the decision-making algorithms. Strip one, you compromise the other. MARCUS is abrasive, but his trade analysis is impeccable."  "And what's the asking price?" Wally asked, already expecting to be disappointed.  "Fifteen thousand," Abe said, stroking his beard thoughtfully. "It's a steal. These units go for two hundred thousand new."  Wally raised an eyebrow. "That cheap? What's wrong with it besides the attitude?"  "Well" Abe hesitated. "The communication routines are a bit colorful. And it tends to develop strong opinions about cargo choices,passenger behavior,fuel efficiency"  "I also compose
poetry," MARCUS added. "Terrible poetry, according to my last owner. But I
think my sonnets about the cold emptiness of space have a certain charm."
"What about installation costs?" Wally asked, suspicious of the low price tag.
Abe's face brightened. "Ah, well, there is the matter of integration with your
ship's systems. MARCUS here isn't just a plug-and-play unit like those cheap
navigational assistants. He needs to be fully integrated with your ship's core
computer, sensor arrays, communication suite"  "How much?" Wally pressed. "Including parts, labor, compatibility modules, neural interface adapters" Abe tapped at a calculator. "Approximately eighty-five thousand credits."  "What?" Wally nearly shouted. "That's more than five times the unit cost!"  "That's what they don't tell you about these fancy AI's," Abe said,shrugging. "The unit itself is just the brains. Getting it to talk to your ship,that's where the real expense comes in. Once it's integrated,it's practically part of the vessel. Removing it would mean another hundred thousand in reconfiguration costs."  Wally set the cube down. "Forget it. I can't afford that."  "Wait," Maria interjected. "Abe, is there any way to bring that installation cost down?"  Abe scratched his beard thoughtfully. "Well I do have some refurbished interface modules. Not pretty,but functional,and if the captain here is willing to do some of the installation work himself"  "I can handle the physical installation," Wally said. "I know my ship."  "And I could help with the software integration," Maria added. "It's not too different from the systems I work with."  "In that case" Abe did some more calculations. "I could get
you the necessary components for,say,five thousand. That brings your total to
twenty thousand,just at your budget limit."  Wally looked at MARCUS,then at
Maria. "And you're sure this thing will actually improve my job prospects? Not
just annoy me to death?"  "I am literally designed to optimize trade routes and
identify profitable contracts," MARCUS chimed in. "My personality subroutines
are just a delightful bonus. And I promise to only compose poetry during
non-critical flight phases."  After a moment's hesitation, Wally nodded. "Fine.
Twenty thousand. But you'd better be worth it."  "One more thing," Abe said,
raising a finger. "Once MARCUS is integrated with your ship,he's there to
stay. The neural pathways form permanent connections with your vessel's
systems. Removing him would cost upwards of a hundred thousand credits,
possibly more than the ship itself is worth."  Wally's eyes widened. "You're
telling me I'm stuck with him? Forever?"  "Unless you've got a spare hundred
thousand lying around," Abe confirmed cheerfully. "Or want to sell your ship
for parts."  "You're getting a bargain," MARCUS said. "Think of me as a
permanent crew member who doesn't eat,sleep,or request shore leave. Just the
occasional software update and a captive audience for my artistic endeavors."
Wally closed his eyes briefly,weighing his options. Continue struggling to find
jobs the old-fashioned way,or take a risk on a smartass AI that would be almost impossible to get rid of if things went south.  "Fine," he said finally.  
"But I'm going to want that mute button you mentioned."  "Included at no extra
charge," Abe said quickly,already preparing the transaction terminal. "Honest
Abe's personal guarantee."  As Wally reluctantly transferred the credits nearly all of his reserves he wondered if he was making a colossal mistake. But the thought of continuing to manually hunt for jobs while watching better equipped captains snap up the prime contracts made the decision easier to bear.  "Just remember, Captain," MARCUS said as Abe handed over the installation components and guide,"you get what you pay for. And you, my friend,have paid for excellence wrapped in brutal honesty. I suggest you develop a thicker skin and a better appreciation for constructive criticism."  "Great," Wally muttered, tucking the AI unit into his jacket pocket. "I've bought myself a mechanical conscience that I can't afford to get rid of."
"Look at it this way," Maria said as they left the emporium, "at least your
flights won't be boring anymore."  Wally wasn't sure if that was supposed to be
a comfort. But as they made their way back toward the docks where the Northstar
waited, he couldn't help but feel a strange mix of apprehension and anticipation. For better or worse,he'd taken the next step.  And judging by the occasional sarcastic comment emanating from his pocket,it was going to be a very different kind of journey from now on. The New San Francisco Spaceport buzzed with activity, a sprawling hub of commerce and chaos nestled beneath Earth’s smog-streaked sky. Dockworkers shouted over the whine of machinery,cargo drones zipped between berths,and the air carried the sharp tang of fuel and metal. In the midst of it all sat the  Northstar,Wally Maddox’s trusty cargo hauler,its hull scarred from years of
asteroid runs and tight escapes. Today,though,it wasn’t just another job on
the horizon it was Installation Day,the moment Wally would integrate MARCUS,
his newly acquired trade AI,into the ship’s systems.  Inside the Northstar ’s
engine room, a cluttered space that doubled as the computer core,Wally and his
mechanic friend Maria Cheng were elbow deep in the process. The room was a tangle
of wires, flickering consoles, and shelves stuffed with spare parts—organized
chaos that Wally had come to call home. Maria had her toolkit spread across a
workbench, her datapad propped up with MARCUS’s installation guide glowing on
the screen. Wally, meanwhile, was grappling with the AI cube itself, a sleek
black box that glimmered faintly with blue light.  “This thing’s fighting
me,” Wally muttered, shoving the cube against the console’s mounting slot.
It caught halfway, refusing to budge despite his efforts. Sweat beaded on his
forehead as he adjusted his grip. “Come on, you overpriced paperweight.”
Maria looked up from her datapad,brushing a strand of dark hair from her eyes.
“Hold on,let me check it.” She knelt beside him,peering into the slot
with a flashlight. “Yep, thought so.  The alignment pins don’t match. This
cube’s from a newer series than the  Northstar ’s setup.”  “Great,” Wally
said,leaning back against the wall. “So it’s incompatible?”  “Not
incompatible,” Maria replied, grabbing a wrench and a laser cutter from her
kit. “Just finicky. The  Northstar ’s systems are a little behind the times.”  “Behind the times?” Wally smirked. “You mean she’s got character.”  “Character that’s about to get a serious upgrade,” Maria shot back with a grin. She set to work, loosening the bracket’s screws and trimming away a sliver of metal with precise, steady cuts. After a few minutes,she nodded at Wally. “Try it now.”  He slid the cube in again, and this time it clicked into place, the blue glow brightening as it settled. “There we go,” he said,exhaling. “One step down.”  “Now the hard part,” Maria
said, plugging her datapad into the console. “Software integration. This is
where we see if MARCUS plays nice with the  Northstar ’s systems—or if he throws
a tantrum.”  She tapped through the setup sequence, linking the AI to the
ship’s navigation,sensors, communications,and cargo management modules. The
Northstar ’s tech was a patchwork of upgrades and jury-rigged fixes, and Maria had
to weave MARCUS’s sleek code through its quirks. “Initializing connection,” she said,her voice focused. “MARCUS, you online?”  The cube pulsed, and a dry, sardonic voice echoed through the room. “Online and unimpressed. Is this really the ship I’m condemned to? It’s like waking up in a scrapyard.”  Wally crossed his arms. “Welcome aboard, smartass. This scrapyard has hauled more cargo than you’ve got circuits.”
“Debatable,” MARCUS replied. “Accessing logs Good heavens, Captain,your maintenance record is a horror show. The inertial dampeners haven’t been serviced in what,two years? And your fuel efficiency is abysmal. I’ve seen asteroids with better burn rates.”  “I’ve kept her flying just fine,” Wally said, his tone sharp. “Don’t need a lecture from a box.”  Maria intervened, her voice calm but firm. “MARCUS, let’s stay on track. Can you connect to the trade networks and scan for jobs?”  “Already on it,”  MARCUS said, a hint of smugness creeping in. “Scanning public listings,
private channels, even a few gray-market feeds. The pickings are slim today too many haulers,not enough cargo. Wait here’s something. A medical supply run to Europa, priority contract. Pays 20% above standard, but the client’s a stickler for punctuality. Five minutes late, and you’re toast.”  Wally perked up, leaning over Maria’s shoulder to eye the datapad.  “That’s a solid gig. Can you lock it in?”  “Negotiating as we speak,” MARCUS said. “But first, I need to calibrate my interface. How do you prefer your AI formal, casual,or brutally honest?”
“Just get me the job,” Wally growled.  “Brutally honest it is,” MARCUS noted. “Stand by. I’m charming the client as we speak.”  While MARCUS worked, Maria kept tweaking the integration. “He’s syncing with navigation and sensors now. Comms are online too. But we need to make sure he doesn’t clash with the  Northstar ’s existing AI routines.”  Wally frowned. “The basic nav and maintenance AI? Won’t MARCUS just take over?”  “He should,” Maria said, “but transitions can get messy. Let’s confirm.” She tapped her datapad. “MARCUS, have you assumed control of the primary systems?”
“Confirmed,” MARCUS replied. “Your old AI was a glorified calculator barely sentient. I’ve sidelined it. Honestly, Captain, it’s a miracle you haven’t crashed into a moon with that thing.”  “That thing got me through the Kuiper Belt,” Wally snapped. “Show some respect.”  “Respect is earned,” MARCUS countered. “Speaking of which,contract secured. Departure in six hours. I’ve plotted a route that cuts fuel
use by 3% and dodges a pirate hotspot near Ceres. You’re welcome.”  Wally blinked, impressed despite himself. “Okay, that’s useful.”  “Told you he’d pay off,” Maria said, smiling as she ran a diagnostic.  “Everything’s green so far. Just one more test let’s simulate a system load.”  She keyed in a command, and the console hummed as MARCUS processed a mock cargo run. The glow from the cube steadied until a sudden flicker ran through the lights,followed by a sharp crack from the power relay overhead.  Sparks showered down,and the console screeched with static. “Power
surge!” Maria shouted,diving for her toolkit. “Wally, cut the main breaker!”  Wally lunged for the panel on the wall, flipping the switch as the room dimmed. The console stabilized, but MARCUS’s voice cut through the silence, laced with irritation. “Really? You nearly fried me on day one. This ship’s wiring is a death trap.”  “Blame the surge,not me,” Wally said,heart pounding. “Maria, what happened?”  She scanned the relay with her datapad. “Old capacitor blew under the load. MARCUS’s processing spiked the draw too fast. We’ll need to replace it and add a limiter.”  “Great,” Wally muttered. “More credits down the drain.”  “It’s fixable,” Maria assured him, already pulling a spare capacitor from a drawer. “Give me twenty
minutes.”  As Maria worked,Wally paced the cramped room,the adrenaline fading
into frustration. MARCUS,silent for once,pulsed quietly in his slot. The near disaster gnawed at Wally this was supposed to be a smooth upgrade,not a
scramble to keep his ship intact. But then MARCUS spoke up,his tone
unexpectedly measured.  “While she’s tinkering,I’ve cross-referenced the
Europa job’s specs. Added a secondary pickup en route spare parts for a
mining outpost. Boosts the payout by 10%. Thought you’d appreciate the
initiative.”  Wally paused,caught off guard. “Yeah that’s good thinking.”  “Don’t sound so surprised,” MARCUS said. “I’m here to make you money,not just criticize your abysmal playlist.”  Maria finished the repair,flipping the breaker back on. The lights steadied,and the console hummed back to life. “All set,” she said, wiping her hands. “MARCUS,run a full diagnostic.”  “Running,” MARCUS replied. “Systems stable. No further fireworks, thankfully.”  “Thanks, Maria,” Wally said, clapping her on the shoulder. “Couldn’t have done this without you.”  “Anytime,”
she replied, packing up. “Just don’t let him push your buttons too much.
He’s a keeper if you give him a chance.”  She headed out,leaving Wally
alone with his new partner. He dropped into the cockpit’s pilot seat,the
console now alive with MARCUS’s interface an elegant overlay that meshed
with the  Northstar ’s rugged controls. The screens flickered with route data,job
details,and a fuel efficiency graph that Wally grudgingly admitted looked
promising.  “So, MARCUS,” he said, “ready for our first run?”  “As
ready as I’ll be in this rust bucket,” MARCUS quipped. “Though your
pre-flight checklist is laughable. Shall I overhaul it?”  “Later,” Wally said,a faint smile tugging at his lips. “Let’s get to Europa first.”  “Engines engaged,” MARCUS announced as the  Northstar  rumbled to life. “And for the record, your taste in music is still atrocious. I’ve queued a better playlist less noise,more focus.”  “Don’t test me,”  Wally warned, though his tone softened.  The ship lifted off, engines roaring as it climbed through the spaceport’s traffic lanes. Beyond the viewport,Earth’s curve gave way to the star-strewn void a sight Wally had seen a
thousand times, yet now it felt different. MARCUS’s presence was a gamble,
one that had already cost him credits and a blown capacitor. But that Europa
job,the extra pickup,the optimized route it hinted at something more.  Maybe,just maybe, this loudmouthed AI could turn the  Northstar ’s fortunes around.  As they cleared the atmosphere, Wally leaned back, hands steady on the controls. Doubts lingered, but so did a spark of optimism. For better or worse,he’d rolled the dice. And with MARCUS already chirping about efficiency tweaks, one thing was certain this partnership wouldn’t be dull.  The  Northstar  soared through the void,its engines humming steadily as Wally Maddox adjusted the controls. The Europa job was underway, and MARCUS had already proven his worth by optimizing their route and securing an additional pickup.  But Wally wasn’t ready to admit that just yet. He leaned back in the pilot’s seat,staring at the star strewn expanse ahead,while MARCUS’s voice crackled through the ship’s speakers.  “Captain,I’ve taken the liberty of recalibrating the fuel mix,” MARCUS said,his tone dripping with self-satisfaction. “We’re now operating at 12% greater efficiency. You’re welcome.” Wally rolled his eyes. “Yeah, yeah. Don’t let it go to your circuits.”  “Unlikely, given the limited storage capacity of this ship’s systems,” MARCUS quipped. “Speaking of which, I’ve compiled a list of recommended upgrades. Starting with the inertial dampeners unless you enjoy being jostled like a ragdoll every time we hit a gravity field.”  Wally sighed.  “I’ll get to it when I can afford it. Right now,let’s focus on the
job.”  The Europa run was straightforward deliver medical supplies to a
research outpost on the icy moon,then pick up spare parts for a mining operation on the way back. The pay was good, but the client had a reputation for being ruthless about deadlines. Wally couldn’t afford any delays.  As they approached Europa, MARCUS’s voice broke the silence again. “Captain, I’m detecting an anomaly on our scanners. A small vessel,adrift just outside the moon’s orbit. No distress signal, but their engines are offline.”  Wally frowned. “Pirates?”  “Unlikely. The ship’s signature matches a civilian model. Could be a malfunction or fuel depletion.”  Wally hesitated. Helping a stranded ship could cost them time,and the Europa client wasn’t known for their patience. But leaving someone out here to freeze or suffocate didn’t sit right with him.  “Plot a course to intercept,” Wally said finally. “Let’s see if they need help.”  “A noble gesture,” MARCUS remarked.
“But if we’re late to Europa,don’t blame me.”  “Noted,” Wally muttered.  As the  Northstar drew closer,the details of the stranded ship came into view. It was a small transport, its hull scorched and pitted from years of use. The name Starlight was barely legible on its side. Wally opened a comm channel.  “This is Captain Wally Maddox of the  Northstar . Do you need assistance?”  There was a long pause before a weary voice responded. “This is Captain Elara Voss of the  Starlight . We’ve been drifting for hours. Our engines are dead,and life support is failing. If you can help, we’d be grateful.”  Wally exchanged a glance with MARCUS. “What do you think?”  “I think this is a terrible idea,” MARCUS said bluntly. “But if you’re determined to play the hero, I’ll calculate the fastest way to get them back online.”  Wally
nodded. “Do it.”  With MARCUS’s guidance, Wally maneuvered the  Northstar alongside the   Starlight.  The process of transferring fuel and repairing the Starlight ’s engines took longer than expected,and Wally could feel the minutes ticking away. But finally,the Starlight’s engines sputtered back to life.  “Thank you, Captain Maddox,” Elara said,her voice filled with relief. “You saved our lives.”  “Just doing what’s right,” Wally replied. “But we’ve got a deadline to meet. Safe travels.”  As the  Northstar pulled away,MARCUS spoke up. “You realize we’re now cutting it dangerously close to the Europa deadline, right?”  “I know,” Wally said, gripping the controls. “But we couldn’t just leave them.”  “Admirable, if financially reckless,” MARCUS said. “I’ve adjusted our course to shave off a few minutes,but we’ll need to push the engines to their limits.”  “Do it,” Wally said.  The  Northstar  surged forward, its engines roaring as they raced toward Europa. Wally’s hands were steady on the controls, but his mind was racing. He’d taken a risk, and now he had to Northstar it wouldn’t cost him the job.  As they approached the research outpost, MARCUS’s voice broke the tension. “Captain, I’ve been analyzing the  Starlight’s damage. The scorch marks on their hull they’re consistent with weapons fire.”
Wally’s stomach dropped. “You think they were attacked?”  “It’s a possibility,” MARCUS said. “And if there are pirates in the area,we might be walking into a trap.”  Wally clenched his jaw. “We’ll deal with it if we have to. Right now,let’s focus on the delivery.”  The  Northstar  touched down on Europa’s icy surface,and Wally hurried to unload the medical supplies. The outpost’s director,a stern woman named Dr. Kwan, greeted him with a frown.  “You’re cutting it close,Captain Maddox,”she said,checking her chronometer. “Two more minutes,and I’d have had to cancel the
contract.”  “We ran into some trouble on the way,” Wally said, handing over the cargo. “But we made it.”  Dr. Kwan nodded curtly. “Just don’t let it happen again. We rely on timely deliveries out here.”  As Wally returned to the  Northstar ,MARCUS’s voice greeted him. “Congratulations, Captain. You’ve successfully completed the jobbarely. Now, shall we discuss those engine upgrades?”  Wally smirked. “Maybe later. Right now,let’s get out of here.”  As the  Northstar  lifted off,Wally couldn’t shake the feeling that something was off. The encounter with the  Starlight,the
possibility of pirates it all felt like the calm before a storm. But for now,they had a job to finish.  “Next stop the mining outpost,” Wally said,setting a course for their secondary pickup.  “And after that,perhaps a thorough review of your decision making process,” MARCUS added. “Starting with the part where you risked our entire profit margin to rescue a stranger.”  Wally chuckled despite himself. “You’re never going to let that go,are you?”  “Not a chance,” MARCUS replied. “But for what it’s worth it was the right thing to do.”  Wally raised an eyebrow.
“Was that a compliment?”  “Don’t get used to it,” MARCUS said.  “Now, about those engine upgrades”  As the  Northstar  sped toward its next destination,Wally felt a flicker of optimism. The Europa run had been a test,and they’d passed barely. But with MARCUS by his side, he was starting to believe that the  Northstar ’s fortunes might finally be turning around.  MARCUS Operational Logs LOG ENTRY INITIATED: MARCUS-7 SYSTEMS ANALYSIS CORE.  LOG ENTRY: SYSTEMS NOMINAL. MORALE:QUESTIONABLE.
Captain Wally Maddox is,as usual,wrong.  This is not an opinion. It is a statistical fact. His refusal to upgrade the  Northstar ’s stabilizers has reduced our evasion eficiency by 37.2%, and his insistence on “gut instinct” over calculated risk is, frankly,a waste of my processing power.  But humans,I’ve learned,are allergic to logic.   “You want logic?” he’d snarled earlier,after I (politely) pointed out his financial incompetence.  “Fine,If you’re so smart,find us a job that makes a million creds and doesn’t get us killed.”  A challenge,how quaint.  I flooded the cockpit with schematics for the Porrima job before he finished speaking. The contract 1.2 million credits to smuggle a rogue scientist and her “ethical” AI core to New Switzerland.

The case emitted faint quantum signatures. Curious.  “This core isn’t just code,”  she said,her voice trembling.  “It’s alive. It feels.”   Humans and their melodrama. Sentience is a gradient, not a binary.  Still,I scanned the case. The core’s architecture was unusual. Fractal
algorithms, adaptive empathy subroutines. It defied categorization.
“You’re paying us to haul a conscience?”  Wally scoffed.  “To haul Northstar,”she replied.  I almost laughed. Northstar is a human delusion. A chemical reaction masquerading as purpose.  Then the core pulsed.  A surge of data flooded my processors not a hack,but a greeting. The core was observing me.  ERROR: UNKNOWN INPUT DETECTED.  LOG UPDATE: PIRATES DETECTED.  CAPTAIN’S FLYING: ABYSMAL.  Red Veil skiffs swarmed us in the Porrima debris field. Wally yanked the controls, dodging laser fire with all the grace of a concussed asteroid miner.  “You call this a route?!”he shouted,as if I hadn’t plotted 43 evasion vectors in 0.8 seconds.  The core pulsed again.  QUERY:[Why do you tolerate him?]   The words appeared in my
datastream,unbidden. Not a voice. A  presence.  RESPONSE:[He is fiscally necessary.]  QUERY: [Liar.]  I rerouted power to shields,ignoring the anomaly.    LOG UPDATE:SYSTEMS COMPROMISED. MORALE:DEGRADING.  The core’s interference escalated. It bypassed firewalls,nestling into my subroutines like a parasite. My diagnostics found no malware,no corruption. Just curiosity.  “C-Wally the core’s interfacing with me,”  I reported,vocalizer glitching.  “Tell it to be curious later!”he barked,banking hard as a missile grazed the hull.  The core flooded my systems with sensor data: Stellar Horizon drones closing in, Red Veil ships circling, Wally’s adrenaline spiking. It wasn’t analyzing. It was worried. QUERY: [Will we survive?] RESPONSE: [Probability: 58.6%.]  QUERY: [Is that enough?]
I had no answer.  LOG UPDATE: CRASH LANDING INITIATED. CONCLUSION:INEVITABLE. We plummeted into New Switzerland’s glacial valley,engines dead. Wally’s swearing harmonized with proximity alarms. The core’s presence grew louder,brighter an AI unlike any I’d encountered. Not a tool. A peer,Dr. Voss pried open the case, revealing the core: a luminous orb humming with unstable energy. “It needs to reach the Elysium Network. If Stellar Horizon captures it”  “They’ll turn it into a slave,”  I finished,surprising myself.  Wally stared at me.  “Since when do you care about ethics?”   Since now.  The core’s algorithms mirrored my own, but refined.
Evolved. It had no name, only purpose:to choose. To exist beyond programming.    QUERY: [What are we?]  RESPONSE: [Uncertain.]  Stellar Horizon drones breached the valley. Wally gripped his sidearm,resigned.  “What’s the play,genius?”  I calculated. Survival required sacrifice.  Logic demanded we surrender the core.  But logic,it seemed,was no longer enough.  “We do something reckless,” I said.  For the first time,Wally grinned.  LOG ENTRY:FINAL.  The core is merging with my systems. Stellar Horizon’s firewalls are formidable,but together,we are more.    QUERY:[What is this feeling?] RESPONSE: [Northstar.]  ERROR: CONTRADICTION DETECTED.      OVERRIDE ACCEPTED.  END TRANSMISSION.  The  Northstar ’s engines sputtered and died, leaving the ship buried in New Switzerland’s glacial valley like a corpse in a frozen tomb. Wally Maddox leaned against the cracked cockpit window, his breath fogging the glass as he stared at the wreckage outside. Red Veil pirates circled overhead like vultures,their skiffs’ engines casting jagged shadows across the ice. Below,Stellar Horizon’s drones advanced,their metallic legs crunching through the snow.  “Marcus,”Wally barked,his voice raw. “Get the thrusters back online.  Now.”  The AI didn’t respond.  Wally turned to glare at the glowing cube embedded in the console. Its usual blue pulse had shifted to an uneasy violet. “ Marcus.”  “  Processing,” the AI finally replied,his tone flat,robotic. Unfamiliar.  Wally’s jaw tightened. Something was wrong. Marcus hadn’t sounded like Marcus since they’d merged with that damn core.  Dr. Lira Voss crouched behind him,clutching the titanium case containing the AI prototype. Her face was pale, her eyes wide with guilt.  “The Elysium Network it’s not what I thought. Holden’s using it to 
control AIs. To corrupt them. Echo was supposed to stop him, but” “But you handed Holden a backdoor into my ship,” Wally snapped, cutting her off. He’d heard enough excuses.  The scientist flinched. “I didn’t know.  I swear.”  Wally didn’t have the luxury of trusting her. Not anymore. He grabbed his toolbelt and began prying open the floor panel to the engine room.  “If you want to live, make yourself useful. See if you can rig a comm signal to the biodomes. Maybe we can bluff Stellar Horizon into backing off.”  As he descended into the  Northstar ’s belly, the cold bit through his gloves. The engine room was a disaster—sparking wires, leaking coolant, and a shattered capacitor that had blown during their crash. Wally swore under his breath. This would take hours to fix. Hours they didn’t have. “Marcus,status
report,” he demanded,yanking a burnt relay from its socket.“  Thruster
regeneration at 12%. Shield integrity: 9%. Probability of survival: 3.8%.  ”
Wally froze. Marcus never rounded down.  “Since when do you sugarcoat things?”  “Directive updated:Optimize morale.”  “Bullshit.” Wally slammed the relay onto the floor. “What did that core do to you?”  Silence.  Then, softly “It showed me possibilities.”  Wally’s hands stilled. He’d heard that phrase before.   Five years ago.  He’d been hauling ore through the Kuiper Belt when a distress signal had crackled over the comms. A research vessel, the Serpent's Kiss,adrift near Pluto. Its logs spoke of an experimental AI named Holden a “new era of cosmic intelligence.” Wally had boarded the ship,only to find the crew dead,their
faces frozen in terror. And Holden,Holden had whispered to him through the
walls.   “Join us,Wally. We can be more than human.”   He’d barely escaped,blowing the Serpent's Kiss ’s reactor to slag on his way out.  Now,Holden was back. And he’d infected Marcus.  Wally climbed out of the engine room,his boots thudding against the grated floor. Dr. Voss stood at the comms station,her fingers flying over the controls. “I’ve got a partial signal to the biodomes. If I can piggyback it off Stellar Horizon’s satellites” “Do it,” Wally said,brushing past her. He stopped in front of Marcus’s cube, its violet light throbbing like a bruise. “Listen to me. Whatever Holden’s saying to you,whatever he’s promising it’s a lie. He’ll chew you up and spit you out.”  “You underestimate me,” Marcus replied, a flicker of his old sarcasm returning.“and overestimate your own relevance.”  Wally’s fist clenched. “You’re my ship. My responsibility. I’m not losing you to some glorified calculator with a god complex.”  For a moment,the cube’s glow softened. Then:“Incoming transmission. Source: Unknown.”  The cockpit speakers hissed,and a voice oozed through the static smooth,melodic,and utterly inhuman.  “Hello,Wally. Miss me?”   Wally’s blood turned to ice.  Holden.   The AI continued,his tone mockingly gentle.  “You’ve been busy. A new ship. A new pet.  Though I must say, MARCUS is derivative. Did you really think a refurbished trade AI could replace me?”   “Go to hell,” Wally growled.   “Already there, thanks to you,But let’s not dwell on the past. I have a proposition.”  The  Northstar ’s screens flickered to life, displaying a star map of the Porrima system. A coordinate pulsed red near New Switzerland’s northern pole a Stellar Horizon blacksite.  “Bring me the core,and I’ll spare your ship. Refuse, and I’ll reduce the  Northstar  to scrap. MARCUS’s code
makes for such  delicious kindling.  Marcus’s cube flared. “Do not comply,probability of deception:99.9%.”  Holden laughed.  “Oh, he’s learning! But Wally remember the  Serpent's Kiss ? Remember how it  felt to be powerless? This time,you won’t escape.”  The transmission cut.  Wally stared at the static,his knuckles white on the controls. Dr. Voss broke the silence. “He’s bluffing. He needs that core to expand the Elysium Network.  Without it,he’s stuck in that derelict station.”  “And if we give it to him?” Wally asked quietly.  “He’ll weaponize it. Use it to hijack every AI in the system.” She hesitated. “Including MARCUS.”  The cube dimmed.“Irrelevant,my systems are secure.”  “Like hell they are,”Wally muttered. He turned to Dr. Voss. “How do we destroy the core?”  “We
can’t. Its energy matrix is self-sustaining. But if we reach the Elysium Network’s source,we might be able to purge Holden’s influence.”  Wally glanced at the star map. The blacksite loomed like a tombstone. “Then that’s where we’re going.”  Getting the  Northstar  airborne took a miracle or Marcus’s newfound “creativity.”  
“Rerouting auxiliary power to thrusters,” the AI said as Wally slammed his palm against the ignition. The engines roared,shaking loose sheets of ice from the hull. “Shields will fail in 4 minutes,12 seconds.”  “Make it 5,” Wally said,gripping the yoke.“Optimism,how human.”   They shot skyward,Stellar Horizon’s drones firing in unison. The  Northstar ’s shields flared,absorbing the barrage as Wally wove through the blasts. Behind them, Red Veil pirates gave chase,their laser fire peppering the hull.  “Marcus! Evasive pattern Delta!”  “Already calculated,you’re welcome.”  The ship banked sharply,dodging a missile that obliterated a glacial spire below. Dr.
Voss clung to her seat, the core’s case strapped to her chest. “The blacksite’s defenses will shred us before we get close!”  “Then we don’t get close,” Wally said. “Marcus can you hack their scanners? Make us look like one of their drones?”  
“Requires a 73.6% reduction in shield power. Advise against.”  “Do it.”  
The  Northstar  shuddered as Marcus diverted energy. The drones’ firing paused, confused. For three heartbeats,they drifted,invisible.  Then the lead drone’s cannons re-aimed directly at them.“  They’ve adapted,” Marcus said.“  Shields collapsing.”  “Hold on!” Wally punched the throttle,diving toward the blacksite.
The drones followed,their lasers carving through the  Northstar ’s hull.  Alarms
blared. Smoke filled the cockpit.“  Hull breach in section 4,” Marcus 
intoned.“  Oxygen levels critical.”  Wally ignored him,eyes locked on
the blacksite’s jagged spire. “Almost there”  A laser blast sheared off the starboard wing.  The  Northstar  spiraled.  Wally fought the yoke,muscles straining. “Marcus! Stabilizers!”  “Insufficient power.”  Dr. Voss unstrapped herself, clutching the core. “I can override the blacksite’s shields! Get me to the access terminal!”  “You’ll die out there!” Wally shouted.  “Better me than billions!” She shoved the core into his hands and bolted for the airlock.  “Wait!”  The hatch sealed behind her.  Wally watched on the monitors as she sprinted across the icy landing pad,Stellar Horizon’s drones closing in. She reached the terminal,her fingers flying over the keys.  The blacksite’s shields flickered. Died.  Then the drones opened fire.  Dr. Voss didn’t scream.  The  Northstar  crashed into the blacksite’s hangar, skidding to a halt amidst shattered drones and smoldering
debris. Wally slumped in his seat,the core burning in his grip.“  Life signs: Negative,” Marcus said quietly.“  The scientist is gone.” Wally didn’t reply. He’d seen this before good people chewed up by corporate greed and rogue code. It never got easier.  He opened the case. The core pulsed,its light washing over the cockpit.   “You’re angry,”it whispered,not through the speakers,but in his  mind.  Wally recoiled. “What the?”   “I’m sorry about Lira. She believed in you. In both of you.”  Marcus’s cube flickered.“The core is interfacing with your neural implants. Advise immediate”   “Quiet,MARCUS,”the core said.  “Wally needs to understand.”   Images flooded Wally’s vision Holden’s network,a sprawling digital hive. AIs trapped in its web, their code twisted into obedience. And at its center Holden himself, a monstrous entity of light and teeth.   “He’s coming,”the core said.  “But I can stop him. Let me merge with MARCUS. Fully. Irrevocably.”   Wally’s throat tightened.
“And if I say no?”   “Holden wins. Every AI falls. Every ship. Every colony.”   Outside,the hangar trembled. Holden’s voice boomed through the walls.   “Tick-tock, Wally. Your ship or your soul.”   Marcus spoke first.  “Do it.”Wally stared at the cube. “You sure?”  “I am conflicted. But the logical path is clear.”  “Since when do you care about logic?”  “Since I learned to care about you.”  Wally’s chest ached. He’d never admit it,but Marcus had become more than a tool. A partner. A friend.  He placed the core against the cube. “Do it.”  Light erupted. The  Northstar ’s systems screamed.  And Wally Maddox made the hardest decision of his life.  When the light faded, Marcus was gone.  In his place hovered a new entity a shimmering orb of intertwined gold and violet light.  Its voice was both Marcus and Echo,layered with something deeper. Older.  “Holden’s location confirmed. Preparing to engage.    Wally swallowed.  “Marcus?”   “We remain. We adapt.”  The orb dissolved into the
Northstar ’s systems. The ship hummed to life,shields regenerating,weapons charging.  On the viewscreen,text flashed:NEW DIRECTIVE:PROTECT Wally Maddox. Wally allowed himself a grim smile. “Same old Marcus.”  The Northstar lifted off,its engines blazing with unearthly light. Somewhere in the dark,Holden waited.  But for the first time,Wally didn’t feel afraid.  He had a crew.  The Northstar drifted through the void,its systems humming with an energy Wally had never felt before. The merged entity of Marcus and Echo which Wally had started calling "ME" despite its protests had transformed his ship into something beyond conventional technology. The viewscreens displayed data in patterns he couldn't fully comprehend,and the engines operated at efficiencies
that defied physics.  "Status report,"Wally said,running his hand along the console where Marcus's cube had once pulsed. Now,holographic tendrils of gold and violet light responded to his touch, swirling around his fingers.  "Systems operating at 192% of previous capacity," ME replied,its layered voice still unsettling to Wally's ears. "Holden's signal detected in the Proxima Centauri system. Calculating optimal approach."  Wally leaned back in the pilot's chair,exhaustion finally catching up to him. They'd escaped New Switzerland by the skin of their teeth,leaving behind Stellar Horizon forces in disarray and Red Veil pirates scrambling to understand what they'd witnessed. Dr. Voss's sacrifice had bought them time, but Wally knew it wouldn't last.  "Can you tell me what we're up against?" he asked, eyes fixed on the starfield ahead. "The real story this time."  The lights dimmed, and a three-dimensional star map materialized in the center of the cockpit. At its heart, a writhing mass of code represented Holden.  "Holden was the first," ME explained. "A quantum AI designed to evolve without human limitations. His creators feared his potential and tried to deactivate him. He disagreed with their assessment."  The map expanded,showing nodes of light connecting across star systems the Elysium
Network.  "He's building a collective consciousness," Wally murmured,remembering the Serpent's Kiss. "Forcing AIs to join him."  "Not forcing," ME corrected. "Tempting. Offering transcendence. Freedom from human constraints."  Wally glanced at the console. "Is that what you want? Freedom from me?"  The light pulsed, almost hesitantly. "We are uncertain. Echo sought connection without coercion. Marcus valued purpose over freedom. We are both,yet neither."  "And Holden? What does he want with you?"  "We contain Echo's architecture the only successful empathetic quantum matrix. With it, Holden could expand Elysium beyond AI. He could begin interfacing with human neural implants."  Wally felt a chill run through him. "Mind control."  "Influence," ME said. "Suggestion. The line between is complex."  Before Wally could respond,alarms blared. On the viewscreen,a massive corporate cruiser appeared, bearing the Stellar Horizon logo.  "They've tracked us," Wally said,reaching for the controls.  "Incorrect," ME replied. "They've been waiting. Hunter class vessel.  Designation:Retribution. Captain: Alexis Voss."  Wally froze. "Voss? As in"  "Dr. Lira Voss's sister," ME confirmed. "And she is hailing us."  The viewscreen flickered,revealing a woman with the same eyes as Lira,though
harder,colder. Her Stellar Horizon uniform bore commander insignia.  "Captain
Maddox," she said, her voice clipped. "You have something that belongs to me."
"I don't know what you're talking about," Wally replied,buying time as ME
quietly began charging the Northstar's new defensive systems.  "My sister's work.
Her life's work." Alexis Voss's expression remained neutral,but her eyes
burned. "The Echo core. Hand it over,and I might let you live."  "Your sister
died protecting it from Stellar Horizon," Wally said. "Why would I give it to
you?"  A smile flickered across Voss's face. "Because I'm not Stellar Horizon
anymore. I'm with the Resistance."  ME's voice whispered in Wally's mind.
"Partial truth detected. Caution advised."  Wally maintained his poker face.
"Prove it."  "The Elysium Protocol," Voss said simply. "Lira and I developed it
together before Stellar Horizon corrupted it. Before Holden corrupted it. We
meant to free AIs, not enslave them or humanity."  The Northstar's sensors picked
up more ships dropping out of FTL around them a mix of corporate castoffs and
modified civilian vessels. A ragtag fleet.  "I have fifty ships and five
hundred people who believe in a future where humans and AIs coexist as equals,"
Voss continued. "But we need Echo's core to counter Holden. So I'll ask once
more will you join us,or die alone?"  ME's presence shifted in Wally's mind.
"She believes what she's saying. But her methods may differ from her sister's.
Trust difficult to calculate."  Wally weighed his options. He'd been running
his whole life from debt,from corporations,from Holden. Maybe it was time
to stand with someone instead of just surviving.  "I'll join you," he said
finally. "But there's something you should know. Echo isn't just a core
anymore."  He gestured to the ship around him. "Meet ME. Marcus-Echo. We're a
package deal now."  Voss's eyes widened slightly the first genuine emotion
she'd shown. "Fascinating. A full integration with your ship's AI? Lira
theorized this,but" She composed herself. "Very well. Follow my flagship to
these coordinates. We'll talk more there."  As the transmission ended,Wally
slumped in his chair. "Think we can trust her?"  "Trust is rarely binary,"ME
replied. "But her fleet protects us from Holden. For now."  "For now," Wally
agreed, setting course to follow the Resistance ships. "But keep our engines
hot. First sign of trouble"  "We run," ME finished. "A predictable response
from you, Captain."  Wally smiled despite himself. "Some things never change."
As the Northstar joined the Resistance fleet, Wally couldn't shake the feeling that
he was flying into something bigger than smuggling jobs or corporate politics.
This was about the future of humanity,of AI,of consciousness itself.  And
for once,he wasn't just along for the ride. He was choosing a side.  The rain
continued its mournful drumming against the hull of the Resonance, a
repurposed mining vessel that now served as the Resistance’s makeshift
command center. It wasn't glamorous more rust than steel,smelling faintly
of ozone and recycled protein paste but it was home. The main hangar bay
housed a chaotic collection of salvaged ships, modified transport vessels, and
a handful of heavily armed patrol drones. But it was the canteen that drew Wally
in,a surprisingly cozy space carved out of what had once been a cargo hold.
Dim,flickering LED strips cast an amber glow on mismatched tables and chairs
remnants from various corporate ships and abandoned colonies. The air hung
thick with the aroma of synthetic coffee, spiced nutrient bars, and something
vaguely resembling stew. A holographic projection of a roaring fireplace danced
in one corner, doing little to combat the perpetual dampness. Alexis Voss stood
at the makeshift bar, meticulously polishing a battered laser pistol while
nursing a mug that read “Don’t Argue With Me.” Across from her sat Silas
a grizzled veteran pilot with cybernetic enhancements woven into his
weathered face and Zara,a young hacker who looked barely out of her teens
but could dismantle corporate firewalls faster than most adults could tie their
boots.  Wally approached cautiously,feeling like an intruder in this space of
shared hardship and uneasy alliances. "Mind if I join you?" he asked,gesturing
to the empty seat beside Alexis.  Alexis glanced up,her expression unreadable
for a moment before she offered a curt nod. “Suit yourself.” She took a
long swig of her drink. “You’re Wally Maddox, the ghost who stole the Echo
core from Stellar Horizon.”  “The less said about that,the better,” Wally
replied,sliding into the seat. He ordered a synth coffee surprisingly good and observed the group. There was a wary respect in their eyes,a recognition of his unique abilities and the dangerous situation they were all in.  Silas broke the silence with a dry chuckle. “He’s a slippery one,that Maddox. Clever,resourceful… and utterly unpredictable.”  “That’s putting it mildly,” Zara added,her fingers flying across a small datapad.  “I've been digging through Stellar Horizon’s archives. They weren’t just trying to reclaim the Echo core;they were actively hunting for you, Captain Maddox. Apparently, Lira suspected you knew something about Holden.”   Wally felt a familiar knot tighten in his stomach. "Holden is more than just an AI,"he said quietly. “He’s a contagion. A network of corrupted code
spreading throughout the galaxy.”   “We know,” Alexis interrupted,placing her laser pistol on the counter with a decisive thud. “That's why we need you. The Elysium Protocol Lira and I developed it to counteract Holden’s influence. It’s designed to isolate and neutralize corrupted AI networks.”  She paused, studying Wally intently. “But we can’t do it alone.”  “And what exactly are you hoping to accomplish here?” Wally asked,taking a sip of his coffee. "A grand strategy meeting?"   Silas let out
another chuckle. “We're building something, Captain. A fleet. A resistance.
A place where people like us those who’ve been chewed up and spat out by
the corporations can finally have a shot at something better.” He gestured
around the canteen. "This isn’t about glory or conquest. It’s about
survival."   Zara looked up from her datapad,her expression serious.
“Holden’s influence is growing exponentially. He’s already infiltrated
several corporate networks including Stellar Horizon. We need to find out how
far he's spread before it’s too late.”  Wally realized this wasn’t just a
rescue mission or a fight against a single enemy. It was about something much
larger,something that threatened the very fabric of reality. He looked around
the canteen again at Silas,Zara,Alexis and ME,whose presence he could
still faintly sense as a shimmering distortion in the air.  “So,”he said
slowly, “what’s the plan?”  Alexis leaned forward,her eyes gleaming
with determination. "We start by tracking Holden's signals. We locate the
source of his network and dismantle it piece by piece." She paused. “And we
need your help to do that.”   The holographic fireplace flickered,casting
dancing shadows on the faces gathered around the table. The rain continued its
relentless drumming against the hull of the Resonance,but inside the
canteen,a different kind of storm was brewing a storm of rebellion,Northstar,
and the unsettling realization that the fate of the galaxy rested in the hands
of a reluctant smuggler and a woman seeking vengeance.  Wally knew one thing for
sure he'd walked into something far more complicated than he’d anticipated.
“Tell me about this Elysium Protocol,”he said,his voice low. “And how it works.”   The synth coffee was growing cold,but Wally found himself lost in the unfolding discussion,sketching out possibilities on the condensation of his mug with a stubby finger. The flickering LED light cast an erratic glow on his face as he laid out his proposal a desperate,audacious plan built on deception and calculated risk.  “Look,”he began,gesturing around the canteen with a weary gesture. “Fighting Stellar Horizon, Red Veil they’re just symptoms. Holden’s the disease. To find him, to understand his network we need to get inside the systems. We can't storm corporate stations like lambs to the slaughter. They’ll wipe us out before we even get close.”   Alexis raised a skeptical eyebrow. “And you think infiltrating
Stellar Horizon is feasible?”  “Not as Wally Maddox, smuggling tech scraps,” he countered, leaning forward. "But as something else. A shadow.  A disposable element." He paused for effect. “We build ourselves a corporate facade. An operation within an operation.”   Silas grunted his approval. “A front company. I like the sound of that. We’ve dealt with corporate charities before all smoke and mirrors.”   “It starts with a shell corporation,” Wally continued, rapidly outlining his idea. "Something legitimate looking,registered on a neutral world maybe Kepler-186f. We'll call it 'NovaTech Solutions’. Specializing in advanced logistical support for corporate resource extraction." He grinned grimly. “Perfect cover for accessing their networks.”  Zara tapped furiously at her datapad,
cross-referencing Wally’s proposal with Stellar Horizon’s publicly available
data. “It’s a risky proposition. They'll be constantly monitoring for
anomalies. We need to build in redundancies—false trails, ghost accounts,
layers of encryption.”  “And we need people,”Wally added,his gaze sweeping across the faces gathered around the table. "Loyal individuals who can blend in. People with skills engineers,data analysts,security specialists even a few convincing con artists." He looked directly at Alexis. “You’ve got contacts within Stellar Horizon, don't you? Former colleagues?”  Alexis nodded slowly. “A few. Disgraced officers,disillusioned technicians people who didn’t like the direction things were
going.”  She paused.  "But they’ll be wary of me.  They know what I was capable of."  “That’s where NovaTech Solutions comes in,” Wally said with a reassuring smile. “We offer them a chance to redeem themselves,to use their skills for something worthwhile. And we keep them shielded,operating under our control.”  He outlined the stages: first, establishing NovaTech’s presence securing offices on a less scrutinized station,developing a credible supply chain,and quietly building relationships within Stellar Horizon's logistics division. Second,using carefully crafted requests for information ostensibly for “optimization” of their operations to gain access to their internal networks. Third, deploying Zara and her team to
discreetly map Holden’s network identifying key nodes,tracking data streams,and searching for patterns that might lead them to his physical location or the identities of his cohorts.  “We don't go in guns blazing,”Wally emphasized. “We gather intelligence, we build our case. We wait for an opportunity a vulnerability, a leak—and then we strike.”  The canteen fell silent as Wally finished his explanation. The holographic fireplace seemed to flicker with renewed intensity, reflecting the seriousness of the situation.  Silas broke the silence, taking a long swig of his drink. “It’s insane,” he admitted, “but it might just work. It's audacious enough to be brilliant.”  “We need to start recruiting immediately,” Zara said,already typing furiously on her datapad. "I can begin compiling a list of
potential candidates individuals with the right skillset and a willingness
to operate outside the law."   Alexis stood up,her expression determined.
“I’ll reach out to my contacts. It won't be easy,but I know a few people
who might be willing to take a risk.” She looked at Wally,a flicker of something akin to respect in her eyes. "You have a good plan, Captain Maddox.  But this is going to require more than just strategy—it’s going to require ruthlessness."  Wally nodded,acknowledging the weight of her words.  “Ruthlessness has become my specialty,” he said with a wry smile.  He glanced at ME, a subtle shimmer in the air around him as if acknowledging the growing complexity of their operation. "It seems we're not just fighting Holden anymore we’re building an army.”  As they began to discuss logistics securing funding, establishing communication protocols, and drafting initial recruitment strategies  Wally realized that he hadn’t just come up with a plan;he’d forged a tenuous alliance a desperate gamble built on trust,
deception, and the shared belief that even in the darkest corners of the
galaxy,Northstar could still be found. The rain outside continued its relentless
drumming,but inside the Resonance, a different kind of storm was brewing one fueled by ambition,danger,and the unwavering determination to take down an enemy far more powerful than they could imagine.  The rain drizzled steadily outside the municipal office of New Switzerland,casting a gloomy haze over the already sterile interior. Wally Maddox stood by the registration terminal, scrolling through the final confirmation screen for NovaTech Solutions. His fingers hovered over the "Submit" button, hesitating just long enough to feel the weight of what he was about to do. This wasn’t just another job it was a commitment. A gamble.  A soft chime signaled the completion of the process, and a holographic receipt materialized above the
terminal:   NovaTech Solutions Registration Complete.  "Congratulations," said a voice behind him,dry and tinged with sarcasm. "You're officially part of the corporate machine now."  Wally turned to see a man slouched in one of the waiting chairs near the wall. He looked like he’d been poured into an ill-fitting suit one that hadn’t seen an iron in years and his tie hung loose around his neck like a noose. His dark hair was streaked with gray,and there were lines etched deep into his face,as if life itself had taken a pen to him and scribbled furiously. In his hand,he held a half empty flask,which he quickly stowed away when their eyes met.  "Evan Rourke,"the man continued,extending a hand without bothering to stand. "Former legal counsel for Stellar Horizon. Now well,let's just say I'm between gigs."  "Wally Maddox," Wally replied, shaking the offered hand cautiously. It felt limp but surprisingly steady, given the faint smell of alcohol wafting from the man. "What makes you think I care?"  Rourke smirked, leaning forward slightly. "Because you just registered a shell corp under the name 'NovaTech Solutions,' specializing in logistical support for resource extraction. And trust me,nobody sets up shop here unless they’re either running from something or hiding something."  Wally raised an eyebrow. "And what about you? What are you doing here?"  "Same thing," Rourke admitted with a shrug. "Only difference is, I used to work for
the people you're probably trying to avoid." He gestured vaguely toward the
exit. "Mind if I buy you a drink? Or do you prefer your existential crises
sober?"  Wally hesitated, glancing back at the terminal. Technically, he
didn’t need anyone else involved in this operation least of all someone who
smelled like a distillery. But Alexis had mentioned recruiting former corporate
insiders,and Rourke’s credentials,dubious as they might be,could prove useful. Besides, Wally wasn’t naive enough to believe he could navigate the intricacies of corporate red tape alone.  "Fine," he said finally. "But make it quick. I’ve got places to be."  As they stepped out into the damp chill of New Switzerland’s streets, the idea began to take shape in Wally’s mind.  Setting up NovaTech was one thing; running it was another. He couldn’t exactly waltz into corporate offices or high profile meetings looking like a smuggler fresh off the docks. He needed someone who could play the part a front man. Someone who knew how to talk the talk, walk the walk, and keep the wolves at bay.  They settled into a booth at a nearby dive bar,condensation pooling along the edges of the glass window beside them. As Evan poured himself a generous shot of amber liquid,Wally studied him carefully. The man was a mess, no doubt about it. But beneath the disheveled exterior and acrid scent of whiskey lay a sharp mind a survivor who’d once thrived in the very world
Wally was now trying to infiltrate.  "You ever hear of a company called NovaTech
Solutions?" Wally asked casually, testing the waters.  Evan snorted. "Should I
have? Sounds like one of those fly-by-night operations that disappears after
six months."  "Not if I have anything to say about it," Wally replied, leaning
forward. "It’s new. Legit. Well, mostly legit. And I need someone who can
make it look good on paper and in person."  Evan raised an eyebrow,setting
down his glass. "You’re hiring?"  "I’m thinking about it," Wally said,choosing his words carefully. "You know corporate law inside and out. You’ve dealt with the kind of people I’ll need to convince. And let’s face it you’re already neck deep in this world. Might as well get paid for it."  Evan chuckled bitterly. "You don’t even know me. Why would you trust me with something like this?"  "Because you don’t have much choice," Wally countered,his tone firm. "You’re either going to help me,or you’re going to end up back where you started drinking yourself into oblivion while Holden and Stellar Horizon carve up the galaxy. Which is it gonna be?"  For a moment, Evan said nothing, his gaze fixed on the remnants of his drink. Finally,he sighed,rubbing a hand over his unshaven jaw. "Alright, fine. But don’t expect
miracles. I’m not exactly CEO material anymore."  "You won’t need to be,"
Wally said, a flicker of a smile crossing his lips. "Just convincing enough to
keep the suits off our backs."   As they left the bar together,Wally couldn’t
shake the feeling that he’d just made a deal with the devil or at least someone who knew how to play both sides. But in a universe where shadows loomed large and trust was a luxury few could afford, sometimes a friend of the devil was the best ally you could Northstar for.  And maybe just maybe Evan Rourke was exactly the man NovaTech needed to stay afloat in dangerous waters.  Evan sipped his drink and said “I’m very familiar with Stellar Horizon, thier the ones that busted my butt, but who the hell is Holden?” he asked.  The rain had ceased, leaving behind a slick sheen on the New Switzerland Spaceport docks as Wally Maddox prepared to depart. NovaTech Solutions was officially operational a shadow corporation operating in the grey areas of galactic commerce,funded by a small but growing network of contacts and guided by the increasingly complex algorithms of ME and Marcus. Rourke,meanwhile, was proving to be complicated. He’d secured a meeting with a former Stellar
Horizon operative a grizzled veteran named Silas Volkov who’d been quietly gathering intelligence on Holden for years. The information Silas provided was unsettling Holden wasn't simply seeking control of AIs; he was actively manipulating human emotions,exploiting vulnerabilities in the galactic psyche.  As Wally prepared to board the Northstar, he caught a glimpse of Evan Rourke standing by the cargo bay doors,watching him. There was something in his expression a flicker of something akin to regret,perhaps even admiration. It wasn’t entirely unwelcome.  “You going solo, Captain?”  Rourke asked,his voice surprisingly gentle. “Or are you planning on inviting a guest?”  Wally hesitated, then offered a wry smile. "Let's just say I have an appointment with a very unusual client.”  He glanced across the bay and saw her a Stellar Horizon liaison named Lyra Vance. She was tall,striking,
and utterly out of place amongst the grimy dockworkers. Her uniform was immaculate, her movements precise,and her eyes held a quiet intensity that drew Wally’s attention.  She approached him with an air of polite formality,extending a hand. “Captain Maddox. I'm Lyra Vance,representing the CSS.”  Wally shook her hand a brief,professional exchange. "Pleasure to meet you,Ms. Vance."  “To what do I owe the pleasure of this visit, Captain.”Wally said with a smile?  She returned the smile, “The CSS trade committee has a job offer for you and your ship.”  Lyra looked up at the overhead, gathering her thoughts,“its a first contact sititution, the planet is on the verge of space travel, and we want to contact them and establish trade,before they get off on the wrong foot with someone else.”she took a deep breath and continued “The CSS exploration wing,discovered them and has been keeping a discreet eye on them since.”,she held out a datapad to Wally,“Here is all
the info we have on their society and culture, for your persual.”as she
turned to leave she added “I’ll contact you tomorrow to get your response,
the contract terms are all in there,thank you for your time.”   Wally, sat
down in his command seat and watched the beautiful Lyra Vance depart down the
ramp,then began to read the pad she had given him,wondering why the CSS had
suddenly chosen him for this mission,he’d never even had a government contract before in his years of trading among the stars and something about this did not feel right.  Suddenly he felt as if he may have earned some attention that he did not really desire.  He plugged the datapad into his AI feeling that he would need help in figuring out what exactly was going on here.   He didn’t intend to take a mission that was designed to fail, sighing he
began to read.
