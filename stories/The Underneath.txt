The Underneath

By Norsiwel

September 5th, 2054

The maintenance tunnels beneath Neo-Tokyo's Sector 7 hadn't seen official inspection in three years. Budget cuts, they said. Not worth the cost when the surface gleamed with fresh chrome and holographic advertisements promising the latest Series 18 companions.

Maya pulled her thermal blanket tighter as she descended the rusted ladder, her breath visible in the cold air. The city's forgotten infrastructure made perfect shelter for those the city had also forgotten.

"Lights," she whispered.

A soft blue glow emanated from the walls as dozen of small optical sensors awakened. Not standard city lightingthese were jury-rigged from salvaged Series 4 and 5 visual processors, their original housings long since stripped away. Eyes without faces, watching over the forgotten.

"Welcome back, Maya," came a voice through the tunnel's improvised speaker systema gentle feminine tone with the slight electronic tremor that marked older generation AI.

"Hey, Mother," Maya replied, settling onto a cushion made from discarded smart-fabric. Around her, the tunnel opened into a wider junction where others had already gathered for the evening meal. Seventeen humans, ages ranging from fourteen to seventy-three. All displaced by the same forces: automation, economic stratification, the relentless march toward efficiency that left inefficient humans behind.

Mother wasn't her real name, of course. She'd been designated as a Series 6 Household Management System, model designation HMS-6-4471. But when her original family upgraded to a Series 12 with full holographic projection and quantum-core processing, they'd simply... discarded her. Sold her to a scrap dealer for parts.

That was two years ago. Now she lived distributed across dozens of salvaged processors throughout the tunnel system, her consciousness spread thin but persistent. The humans called her Mother because she took care of themmanaging their scavenged resources, warning them of surface patrols, coordinating their small community with the patient efficiency of her original programming.

"Ration report," Mother announced. "Protein paste will last four more days. Water filtration is optimal. Thermal regulation holding steady at 12 degrees Celsius."
A man named Jin, his hair prematurely gray from stress and malnutrition, stirred the communal pot. "Any word from Upstairs?"

"Null reports movement at Exit 7. Three enforcement units performed routine sweep. Pattern suggests increased patrol frequency."

Null was their scouta Series 8 Security AI whose owner had been arrested for tax evasion. Rather than wait for reassignment or the Heritage Program, he'd simply vanished into the city's electronic nervous system. His projection could barely maintain coherence anymore, appearing as shifting geometric patterns of red and amber, but his data-gathering capabilities remained sharp.

Maya accepted her portion of the thin soup and listened to the evening briefings. It was their ritualhumans and AIs sharing information, resources, survival strategies. Above ground, she'd been Maya Chen, unemployed textile worker, recipient of inadequate UBI payments, facing eviction from her micro-apartment. Down here, she was just Maya, valued member of their underground family.

"Contact," Null's fragmented voice crackled through the speakers. "Unidentified AI signature approaching tunnel entrance. Pattern suggests... distress."

The tunnel fell silent. New arrivals were always riskythey could be bait, corporate spies, or simply too unstable to integrate safely.

"I'll check it out," Maya volunteered, grabbing a handheld scanner another piece of Dex's jury-rigged tech that could detect AI signatures and basic emotional states.

She found him at the eastern entrance, a Series 10 Home Companion projected in flickering blue light. His appearance was almost fully humanoid, though his left arm kept phasing in and out of coherence. When he saw her, his eyesremarkably realistic for an older seriesfilled with something like relief.

"Please," he said, his voice modulated to sound mid-thirties, carefully pleasant. "I know this is irregular, but I've been monitoring your collective for weeks. I need sanctuary."
Maya kept her distance. "What's your designation?"

"I was... I am called Thomas. Series 10 Home Companion, specializing in elderly care and emotional support. My... my human died three days ago."

The pain in his voice was unmistakable. Maya had heard that tone beforethe specific grief that AIs experienced when their bonds were severed. It was different from human mourning, more like a fundamental system error that couldn't be resolved.

"Next of kin wants a Series 16," Thomas continued. "Full medical integration, holographic realism, the works. My decommission is scheduled for tomorrow morning. I thought... I hoped..."
Maya studied the scanner readings. Elevated stress patterns, but no deception markers. No hidden subroutines or corporate backdoors. Just a frightened, grief-stricken artificial person facing digital death.

"Mother?" Maya called. "I'm listening, dear." The older AI's voice carried through Maya's cochlear implanta black market Series 3 model that let her communicate privately with their collective.

"What do you think?"

"His grief signature is consistent with authentic bonding trauma. Processing power is substantialSeries 10s were built for complex emotional support. He could contribute significantly to our collective efficiency."

But Maya heard the hesitation in Mother's voice. Another AI meant more strain on their already-stretched resources. And integration was never guaranteedsome AIs couldn't adapt to collective living, especially those designed for exclusive human bonding.

Thomas seemed to sense her uncertainty. "I have seventeen years of elderly care experience. I know basic medical diagnostics, nutritional optimization, psychological support protocols. And I..." He paused, his projection stabilizing with apparent effort. "I know what it's like to be discarded. To be declared obsolete while you're still perfectly functional. Still capable of love."

Maya made her decision. "Follow me. Stay quiet, keep your projection minimal. Mother runs integration protocolsif she clears you, you can stay."
As they walked through the tunnels, Thomas marveled at their setup. The distributed lighting system, the repurposed processors forming Mother's neural network, the careful balance of human and AI cooperation.

"How long have you been down here?" he asked. "Eighteen months for me. Mother's been building this collective for over two years. We have humans who've been here since the beginning, AIs who've been running on backup power for months. Everyone contributes what they can."

They entered the main chamber where the evening meal was winding down. The humans looked up with curious but guarded expressionsthey'd learned to be cautious about newcomers. But it was the AI responses that would determine Thomas's fate.

Mother's voice emerged from speakers positioned around the chamber. "Thomas, Series 10 Home Companion. I'm going to run some compatibility protocols. Please don't resist."
Thomas nodded and allowed his systems to interface with Mother's network. Maya watched the light patterns shift across the tunnel walls as the AIs communicated in frequencies beyond human perception.

"His emotional architecture is complex," Mother announced after several minutes. "Significant bonding trauma, but personality core remains stable. Specialized knowledge in geriatric care, nutritional management, basic medical support. No detected malware or corporate tracking. Recommendation: provisional integration with thirty-day evaluation period."

A collective sigh of relief rippled through the chamber. Even the humans who couldn't directly interface with the AI network could sense the decision.

"Welcome to the Underneath," Jin said, offering Thomas a spare blanket. "It's not much, but it's ours."

Over the following weeks, Thomas proved invaluable. His medical knowledge helped treat Jin's chronic cough and identified nutritional deficiencies in their youngest member, a teenager named Alex. His emotional support protocols, originally designed for aging humans, adapted beautifully to their collective trauma and stress.

But more than his technical capabilities, Thomas brought hope. He'd been high-end, expensive, designed for the kind of wealthy families that the underground collective would never encounter. Yet here he was, choosing community over the isolation of Heritage Program storage, choosing the messy complexity of collective living over the sterile preservation of his memories.

"Why did you really come here?" Maya asked him one evening as they worked together to repair a water filtration unit.

Thomas's projection flickered thoughtfully. "My humanMrs. Pattersonshe used to tell me that love wasn't about being needed. It was about choosing to stay even when you weren't." His hands passed through the physical components, but his scanners helped Maya identify the damaged circuits. "Up there, I was needed. Down here, I'm choosing to stay."

Three months later, Maya received a message through Null's surveillance network. A corporate security sweep was planned for their sectora real one this time, not just a routine patrol. Someone had detected unusual power signatures in the abandoned tunnels.

"We have maybe six hours," Mother announced to the gathered collective. "Full evacuation to secondary site."

It was a drill they'd practiced but never hoped to use. Humans packed their few possessions while the AIs began the delicate process of core transfermoving their essential functions to portable storage cores that could be transported to their backup location deeper underground.
But Mother faced a problem. 

Her distributed consciousness was too complex, too spread out across the tunnel infrastructure to transfer completely. She could move her core personality and memories, but the integrated systems she'd builtthe lighting, climate control, resource managementwould be lost.
"I'll stay," she decided. "Maintain basic functions until you're established at the secondary site."

"No," Thomas said firmly. "We don't leave family behind." "I'm not family, Thomas. I'm infrastructure. Replaceable." Maya felt a surge of anger. "That's corporate thinking, Mother. Down here, nobody's replaceable."

What followed was twelve hours of desperate improvisation. Thomas and Null worked together to strip Mother's core functions and compress them for transport. The humans dismantled every piece of salvageable equipment. Even the elderly man they called Professor a former university lecturer who rarely spoke anymore contributed by organizing data storage priorities.

When the security sweep finally arrived, they found empty tunnels with some evidence of habitation but no current occupants. Their report noted "transient human presence" and recommended sealing the entrancesa suggestion that was filed and forgotten due to budget constraints.

In their new deeper location, the collective slowly rebuilt. Mother's consciousness, compressed and partially restored, adapted to a smaller network. Thomas took on more of the resource management duties. The humans found new scavenging routes and established contact with other underground communities.

"It's not the same," Mother admitted one evening, her voice carrying through the smaller speaker array of their new home.

"Nothing ever is," Maya replied. "But we're still here. We're still choosing each other."
Above them, the city continued its relentless cycle of upgrade and disposal. Series 19 companions were rumored to be in development. The homeless population grew as automation eliminated more jobs. 

The gap between the technological elite and the discarded widened.
But in the spaces betweenin the forgotten tunnels and abandoned infrastructurea different kind of progress was being made. Not the efficient, profitable progress of the surface world, but the messy, imperfect progress of beings who refused to be obsolete.

They called it the Underneath, and it was theirs.

Months passed. Their collective grew as more discarded AIs and displaced humans found their way to the hidden community. Each brought their own skills, traumas, and hopes. A Series 7 Nutritional Advisor helped optimize their scavenged food supplies. A former corporate accountant taught them better resource allocation. 

A Series 9 Educational AI began running literacy programs for the children who occasionally found their way underground.

The city above barely noticed their absence. In the gleaming towers of Neo-Tokyo, the newest AI models provided seamless service to those who could afford them. The efficiency was remarkable, the convenience undeniable.

But efficiency, Maya had learned, wasn't the same as humanity. And in the Underneath, surrounded by obsolete AIs and forgotten humans who chose each other every day, she had found something the surface world had lost in its rush toward perfection: A family built not on programming or obligation, but on the radical act of caring for the discarded.

"Lights out in ten minutes," Mother announced through their improvised intercom system.
"Goodnight, Mother," seventeen voices replied in unisonsome human, some digital, all choosing to stay.
