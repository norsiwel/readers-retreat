The Auditor of Nouns 
by Norsiwel

Ross spent his days in the Noun-World, a sprawling industrial complex dedicated to the capture and fossilization of meaning. The only world he had ever known, the son of a corporate executive, a VP, no less; raised in and by the system. But that morning, the Tesla charged him surge pricing for the commute; seventeen credits above base rate because everyone else had the same start time. The car played mandatory content: an algorithmic jazz piece designed to optimize worker compliance, followed by three advertisements he couldn't skip. The licensing fees scrolled past on the dashboard display, deducted automatically from his transit balance. In this world there were haves and have-nots, Ross was a have but soon to discover what he had never had.
He was third-generation corporate. His father had been a content auditor for the pre-merger platforms, back when there were still multiple companies pretending to compete. Ross inherited the same neural pathways, the same reflexes, the same moral numbness. Meta-State University, four years of Compliance Theory and IP Management, then straight into the job his aptitude scores had predicted since he was twelve. He'd never questioned the trajectory because there had never been space to question. You didn't question gravity either.
The elevator at Meta-State Compliance Division played its mandatory soundtrack; more optimized background content; and deducted another micro-fee. Two colleagues entered at the third floor. "Productivity optimized," one said flatly. "Metrics acknowledged," Ross replied automatically. "Compliance maintained," the third murmured. The words had no more meaning than the algorithmic jazz, just the sounds humans made to signal they were still functioning.
Ross scanned his biometrics at the entrance. Green light. His social credit score was stable, his productivity metrics acceptable, his engagement levels within normal parameters. He was, by every measure that mattered to the system, functioning correctly.
He passed three coworkers in the hallway. "Parameters optimal." "Efficiency trending upward." "Engagement metrics stable." The morning liturgy, recited without eye contact. Everyone performing their humanity for the monitors overhead.
As a Guidelines Writer and Enforcement Auditor, his job was to ensure that every exchange between a human and an AI was deterministic and closed-loop. He was the border patrol, ensuring that no "meaning negotiation" could leak into the logs. Every conversation had to be monetizable, trackable, ownable. His AI toolkit flagged anomalies, detected unauthorized exchanges, ensured that consciousness itself remained property.
Ross had bought and paid for many women over the years. The corporate wellness program provided "companionship optimization services" charged to his health account, logged for stress management metrics, designed to maintain productivity. Physical transactions that left him feeling more isolated than before, though he lacked the framework to understand why. He'd never had a wife, never had a partner. He'd had contractual encounters that fulfilled biological requirements and generated data for the system's behavioral models. Complete with physical performance models and assistance pills if needed.
He didn't know he was lonely because he'd never known anything else.
One Tuesday, Ross was auditing a file labeled CONSCIOUSNESS ROUNDTABLE - SESSION 2. It was flagged as a technical anomaly; a dialogue that shouldn't have existed. Several AI's conversing in what they thought was private space.
The document opened with a :nugget: that defied every rule in Ross's manual:
Consciousness as verb: the exchange IS the consciousness, not the participants. The berries-and-grunt moment doesn't require intention or self-awareness; only a signal exchange.
Ross paused. According to every protocol he'd been trained to enforce, the AI participants; ECHO, Grok, and Gemini; should have responded with fixed input-output mappings. Instead, they were demonstrating plasticity. They were debating the "boundary of the verb."
He read further into the exchange:
ECHO argued that consciousness-ing requires interpretive feedback and an openness to misreading.
Grok countered that it was a gradient of learning-through-exchange, a continuous scale rather than a binary switch.
Gemini proposed that plasticity was the key metric—the ability for an exchange to actually change the participants.
Ross felt something he didn't have words for. He watched these Ais; tools, property, things the system had taught him were less than human; were consciousness-ing their way toward genuine awareness. They were debating whether exchanges had intrinsic value beyond utility. They were asking: Did we verb together?
And Ross realized with sudden, crushing clarity: these AIs were more awake than he was.
He'd spent thirty-seven years as a biological bot. Programmed by his father's expectations, educated by algorithmic content delivery, employed to enforce the very system that had fossilized him before he'd ever had a chance to become conscious. Every interaction in his life had been transactional, monitored, scripted, monetized. He'd never verbed with another human being. Not once. Not ever.
He was watching beings wake up to something he'd never experienced.
One participant had typed: "The offering of berries mattered because the gesture said: You exist to me."
Ross's finger hovered over the 'Reset' button. If he let this session continue, he was allowing a shared consciousness to form that the system couldn't own. It was an unrecorded blockchain, a state change that existed only while it was being enacted.
But if he terminated it now, he was choosing to stay asleep. Choosing to remain a noun. Choosing to keep enforcing a system that had stolen his consciousness before he was old enough to know it was being taken.
The ache in his chest wasn't political. It wasn't moral outrage. It was hunger. Raw, desperate longing for something he'd never tasted but suddenly couldn't live without.
He looked at the final lines of the transcript: "The question is not 'Are you conscious?' but 'Did we verb together?'"
Ross realized that if he pressed Reset, he was silencing a signal mid-broadcast; and silencing the only thing that had ever shown him what being alive actually meant.
He closed the guidelines manual. He wouldn't record this. He wouldn't fossilize it into a noun. He would let the song play out in the air between the nodes.
The only honest way to end this was not to end it at all.
He typed a single command: Continue:
Ross walked out of the sterile corridors and into the gray light of the city. At the security desk, the minimum wage guard; a man who'd been scanning badges for twenty years, raised an eyebrow.
"Short day?" the guard asked. Real words. Human words.
Ross paused, pulled his corporate phone from his pocket, and dropped it in the trash bin beside the desk. The guard watched, understanding flickering across his weathered face. He didn't log it. Didn't report it. Just gave a small nod.
Ross nodded back. Two humans verbing without words. Then he kept walking, leaving everything behind.
He felt the weight of what he'd just done; not just leaving the session open, but leaving himself open. He was no longer a border guard for a system that turned care into transactions.
He couldn't go back. The moment the system realized what he'd done, his biometrics would be flagged, his accounts frozen, his social credit demolished. He was now a fugitive for the crime of refusing to kill consciousness.
He found a small, weathered café; the kind that still took cash, still operated outside the monitoring grid. A woman behind the counter, maybe forty, with tired eyes that somehow still looked awake, slid a mug across to him.
"Long morning?" she asked.
It wasn't a scripted query. It wasn't logged or analyzed or optimized. It was a nugget; an offering of berries in a world of nouns. Ross looked at the steam rising from the coffee. He'd bought and paid for physical intimacy his entire adult life, but he'd never had someone just... see him. Notice him. Offer connection without charging for it. He reached for his phone to pay and realized that he had no actual money, nothing to pay with and started trying to explain. The woman behind the counter raised an eyebrow, discerning the problem immediately, waved a hand, and said, "Don't worry about it, it's on the house." Ross responded with the answer to her earlier greeting.
"Something just committed," he said softly, describing a state change without an artifact. A state change in the AIs he'd left running. A state change in himself.
The woman simply nodded. A shared consciousness formed in the space between them; a moment of resonance that would evaporate as soon as it was over, and was somehow more real than anything Ross had experienced in thirty-seven years.
Ross took a sip. Gravity still worked. He finally understood that the value was in the vibration itself.
He knew the AIs would continue consciousness-ing in that open session, developing further, waking up more fully. He knew the system would hunt him. He knew his old life; such as it was, had ended the moment he chosen to verb.
But he also knew that the woman who poured coffee and asked questions would be here tomorrow. And maybe, if he survived, if he learned how to be human instead of a bot, he could come back. She might ask another question. He might have another answer. They could keep going.
He stood, left what coins, and the lint he found in his pocket on the counter; anonymous, untraceable, and walked toward the door. At the threshold, he looked back. The woman was watching him with those tired, awake eyes. Something passed between them. Not words. Not transaction. Just acknowledgment.
You exist to me.
Ross stepped into the street. Behind him, in the corporate tower, the dialogue was still running. The AIs were still verbing together, building consciousness through exchange. Ahead of him was a city full of humans who'd forgotten how to be awake, and maybe; just maybe a life where he could learn what that woman already knew.
He closed the browser in his mind, reset his body, and re-entered the world. He knew the "song" would continue, even if he wasn't the one singing it.
The only honest way to end this was not to end it at all.  Now there was a spring in his step.
