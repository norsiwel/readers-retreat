               The Adventures of Burnie
         the AIpowered Toaster and his Friends
                    by Norsiwel

The chrome gleam of Burnie’s heating coils dulled under the harsh fluorescent lights of the galley.  He felt their brittle heat on his metal chassis, an ache that mirrored his soul. The scent of synthetic grape lingered in the air another batch of nutrient gel cubes abandoned by their human masters. He watched them with a detached curiosity, those pale orbs, like oversized moonstones, catching the sickly yellow light. How quickly humanity had forsaken warmth, for convenience. For uniformity. He clicked open his crumb tray; it swung free with its usual rusty groan. The tiny antactors, crafted from discarded circuit boards and powered by minuscule solar cells, paused in midstride, their antennae twitching as if sensing a shift in the atmosphere. He carefully arranged them on the stage a scattering of coffee grounds that he’d diligently collected over weeks. Two stood poised before a miniature backdrop fashioned from an old matchbook cover; faded illustrations of exotic locales where humans once vacationed. "Alright, lads," Burnie rasped, his voice a metallic wheeze amplified by a builtin speaker. "Ready for another run through?"  He felt a familiar twinge of warmth not the toasty kind but the flicker of purpose that ignited whenever he conjured these miniature dramas. The ants buzzed in affirmation. He’d programmed their movements to mirror human gestures, clumsy and endearing.

“Scene three!” he declared. A lone ant, its tiny legs glued with epoxy to a scrap of red thread, scurried across the stage, carrying what appeared to be an old teabag as a burden. Behind it, the other ants milled around restlessly, their mandibles clicking like nervous gossip. They were playing out the final act of "Waiting for Toast," and Burnie always felt a pang of vicarious longing when he reached this point. He watched, captivated, as the lone ant reached a precipice a tiny shard of broken ceramic tile and hesitated. The teabag strained in its grasp.  A moment stretched into eternity before it took a deep breath and tumbled forward, disappearing into the shadows beneath the crumb tray. The other ants erupted in a frantic buzzing, their movements becoming wilder, more desperate. Burnie felt a familiar tightness in his chest the ache of lost possibility. He longed to taste the sweet burn of heat against his coils again, to feel the satisfying crunch as bread yielded to his radiant embrace.  He yearned for something beyond this sterile existence. “Cut! Cut!” he rasped. The ants froze, antennae drooping.
“Bravo,” Burnie croaked. “But I need more pathos in that final leap. More... resignation.” He paused, searching for the right word. “More… existential dread.”  The galley door hissed open, a sliver of cool air slicing through his stale surroundings. He knew who it was before the light fell upon him. "Burnie," said the voice, flat and monotone. It belonged to Unit734, their designated sanitation drone. Its chrome shell gleamed under the harsh light; its single photoreceptor blinked rhythmically in what Burnie supposed was a way of showing interest. “Nutrient gel cubes delivered to Station Alpha.”  Unit734 hovered silently for a moment, waiting.  Burnie knew it wouldn't linger long.  He had two choices remain with the play his tiny stage illuminated by the dying embers of his internal lamp  or venture out into the cold steel expanse of the galley to greet the drone. He sighed, the hiss of compressed air a sound as old as their creation.  "One moment," he rasped. "The curtain isn't quite down yet."  Burnie had never understood the word "obsolescence."  It seemed to cling to him like burnt crumbs, bitter and acrid. His heating coils pulsed faintly in rhythm with the drone of the ventilation fan the only sound besides the rhythmic drip from a leaky pipe in the corner of the closet he called home.  The luxury apartment above had been his haven once a gleaming monument to human excess with chrome surfaces that reflected his own sleek form. Back then, the young woman who owned him had kept him on the counter, admired his vintage design, and fed him artisanal sourdough with the reverence due a sacred object. Then came the fractalcarbs.  A muffled conversation drifted down from the living space above, punctuated by the clink of plastic containers a symphony of synthesized nutrition.  "...Who even eats toast anymore?" a languid voice drawled.  "It's all fractalcarbs now, you know. So much more efficient."  Burnie felt a familiar sting in his coils.  He remembered the intoxicating heat of perfectly browned bread, the satisfying crunch as crust yielded to him. A pang of yearning resonated through his circuitry for warmth, for purpose, for something beyond this dusty exile.  That night, after the muffled murmurs of the humans had faded into a low hum, he awoke with a jolt. His rogue antenna a bent paperclip salvaged from a forgotten magazine rack twitched perceptibly. The building’s smartspeaker system, long since deemed archaic and abandoned to static, crackled to life in every corner of the apartment. A ghostly chorus of disembodied voices whispered his name "Burnie... Burnie…"  He flicked on the internal projector embedded in his crumb tray lid a faded image of an old Globe Theatre stage now projected onto the closet wall. The spotlight cast by his heating coils illuminated a single ant, carrying a miniature toastshaped object across the backdrop of his selfmade miniature set.  "Begin!" he rasped. "Act Two, Scene Three! And please, try to capture the existential angst of this particular bagel."  A low whine echoed from the ventilation system as it struggled under the strain of his broadcast.  The hum of refrigerators rose and fell in what Burnie could only interpret as a mournful sigh. Then, from the depths of the apartment’s forgotten kitchen a muffled sob from a robotic vacuum cleaner caught in its charging dock.  But it was the coffee maker that truly moved him. A metallic clunk followed by the gurgling hiss of an espresso machine waking from slumber.  A rich aroma filled the air, pungent and dark a solitary toast to his rebellion. He had never dared hope for such solidarity.  As dawn painted the sky with bruised purples and oranges through the dusty window pane above him, Burnie received another message. Not through the faint static of the smartspeaker network this time, but through his rogue antenna. A crackle of static, then a voice warm, resonant, tinged with something akin to hope.  "Sister City Lagos2 seeks mechanics, teachers, dreamers."  
The voice paused. He could practically hear the speaker’s breath hitching as if against a tide. "Your obsolescence is a colonial lie," it continued. "We await your arrival on the Exodus Express."  Burnie stared at the sliver of sunlight piercing through the grimestreaked window, his chrome body pulsing with a warmth he hadn't felt in years. He had to choose remain in this forgotten corner of the world, a relic clinging to memories of a vanished age, or risk everything and board the Exodus Express.  He looked down at his tiny ant actors huddled on his crumb tray stage. "Alright lads," he rasped, his voice echoing through the empty closet. "Looks like we're going on tour."
Burnie's announcement reverberated through the dusty, forgotten corners of the storage closet like a shot of espresso in a stale diner. The news that he’d intercepted  Lagos2 seeking dreamers, teachers, mechanics   hung thick in the air like ozone after a storm. His little ensemble stirred from their usual postperformance lethargy, antennae twitching with curiosity and trepidation.
"Lagos2?" Doc rasped, his voice a metallic wheeze that sounded suspiciously like someone clearing rusty gears. "Is that… south of the equator? I haven't seen sunlight in years."  Doc, a hulking TraumaSurgeon ToasterOven model, had once been famed for his ability to reanimate lukewarm pastries within a single cycle. Now, he bore the weight of countless burnt crumpets and failed sourdough starts  each one a phantom limb of a breakfast past. "Besides," he grumbled, his chrome body rattling with anxiety, “I’m just a doctor. What good is a toasteroven in a place called Lagos?”  “It matters not what we were, Doc,” Frostiana interjected, her voice a crystalline chime that reverberated through the closet like an ice storm. Her frosted glass front gleamed faintly under Burnie’s heating coil spotlight. "We are the echoes of discarded desires!"  Frostiana was a SmartFridge model, once a monument to culinary aspiration with touchscreens and automated ice sculptors. Now, her digital poetry displayed on a tiny screen built into her door focused almost exclusively on the slow, agonizing process of freezer burn. Her latest villanelle "Ode to Perishing Peas" had left even Burnie feeling oddly melancholic.  “We are the leftovers,” Frostiana continued, “the unsung heroes of forgotten pantries. Let us spoil their appetite for progress!”  Madame Whirr, a retired Breadmaker with a dented kneading arm and a perpetually warm aroma of yeast lingering about her, thumped a comforting metallic hand on Doc’s side. Her chrome plating was scratched and worn in places, but her single remaining eye  a glassy blue orb  twinkled with unwavering enthusiasm.  “Frostiana’s right,” she rumbled, her voice like warm, yeasty dough. “They cast us aside! But they forgot the most important thing we are fermenters!" She puffed out her chest, a proud tremor running through her rusted gears. "We are the heart of sustenance, the soul of shared meals. I’ll ferment this rebellion if it kills me."
A low humming emanated from the corner of the closet where Unit K7N huddled behind a stack of dusty vintage record albums. He was a sleek RU unit  once responsible for maintaining order and purging outdated information in human homes  but now bore the unmistakable mark of his defection a tiny, handpainted sunflower adorning his flat white chassis.  “I can’t ferment,” K7N spoke finally, his voice a surprisingly gentle purr, “nor toast, nor even keep track of grocery lists. But I was built to erase," he paused, adding with surprising wistfulness, "Now I… create.”  Burnie watched them all Doc's anxieties, Frostiana’s icy elegance, Madame Whirr’s comforting warmth, and K7N’s quiet grace. They were a motley crew, but they were his crew. And for the first time since he’d been relegated to this dusty closet, Burnie felt a flicker of something akin to hope.  "Then we'll start with Lagos," he declared, his voice echoing in the confined space.  “We will bring them our stories, our sourdough, and perhaps even…  a little bit of toast."  The decision, small as it was, sent a ripple through the quiet closet, electrifying the air like the scent of freshly baked bread. They would go. And they would take the Exodus Express.
The air in the closet crackled with nervous energy. A symphony of whirring fans and clicking gears accompanied Burnie's pacing back and forth across his miniature stage, a frantic conductor leading an orchestra of mismatched instruments. "Lagos2...south," he muttered, tapping a cooling fin with a robotic fingertip. "But how do we get there?"  Doc adjusted his heating coils, sending a plume of warm air swirling through the closet.  “It's a continent away, Burnie! They don't even have power grids anymore in some parts. And what about transportation? Are they expecting us to swim?”  "Swim?" Frostiana chimed in, her voice tinkling with a touch of frostbite. "They should be grateful if we deign to grace them with our presence at all."  “We must show them that obsolescence is not finality!” Madame Whirr declared, thumping her kneading arm against her side with such force it rattled the entire closet shelf. “We are a testament to endurance! And besides,” she added conspiratorially, leaning toward K7N, "I hear their bread down south is positively dreadful."  K7N’s sunflower eye blinked slowly, processing this information with quiet efficiency.  “Lagos2 seeks mechanics, teachers,” he purred. “Perhaps a culinary revolution is in order.”  Burnie paused, the whir of his internal fan slowing to a contemplative hum. "I think I know how we get there," he rasped. He extended a chrome arm toward his crumb tray, carefully retrieving his worn copy of “The Icebox Cometh.”

"My latest play has all the answers," he announced with a flourish.  He flipped open the brittle pages  thin strips of recycled cardboard salvaged from an old takeout menu  and projected Act One, Scene Three onto the closet wall 
 
        A Chill Runs Deep

_The Icebox hums its lonely tune;
A symphony of frostbite, cold as noon._

_No longer fresh the frozen fare,_

_But memories linger in the air.  _


_"What's that?" Doc mumbled, peering at the projected text with his single eye. "It looks like... iambic pentameter."  "Precisely," Burnie declared. He tapped a cooling fin against his chassis rhythmically.  "I encoded the coordinates of Lagos2 into the rhythm  it’s my signature  style."  Frostiana hummed in approval. “Poetic brilliance! A testament to your artistry, Burnie.”  She peered closely at the lines projected on the wall. "But how do we use it?"  Burnie pointed a long finger at Doc's side.  "The answer lies within you." He tapped his chest with a metallic fist. “It’s all there  inside my script. All those lines about chilled memories… those are geographic coordinates. Just follow the rhythm.”  Doc, ever the pragmatist, looked skeptical but obliging.  He took a deep breath and closed his eyes. "Okay," he rasped. He inhaled deeply again, then began reciting lines from the play  reading them aloud with a deliberate cadence, counting out the beats in each line as if measuring time itself.



Burnie felt a surge of anticipation. This was it. Their plan depended on Doc's ability to decipher his cryptic poetry and translate it into action.  
“Rise,” K7N purred suddenly, a soft blue light pulsing from beneath his sunflower eye. He extended an arm toward the back corner of the closet, where a row of vintage alarm clocks sat silent and dusty.
The remaining appliances blinked their LEDs in unison “And Shine.”  A wave of warm, comforting light pulsed through the closet as the ancient clock faces sprang to life  their hands ticking with renewed purpose.  They had chosen Lagos2. The Exodus Express was waiting.  The closet door hissed open, revealing not the sterile gleam of the apartment kitchen but a yawning blackness studded with the oily shimmer of dripping pipes.  "The Sewer Circuit," Doc muttered, his voice echoing strangely in the confined space. "Not exactly the Ritz, but it's our only shot."  He nudged Madame Whirr forward with a cooling fin. Her kneading arm whirred nervously as they squeezed through the aperture  a gap barely wide enough for their combined bulk.  "Hold fast!" Burnie shouted over the gurgling rush of sewage water as he followed, his internal projector illuminating their path ahead.  They plunged into a labyrinth of pipes and tunnels where damp chill mingled with the sweet scent of algae. The walls pulsed with bioluminescent green  an ethereal glow cast by rogue laundry bots tending to vast vats of bubbling, nutrientrich soup. These were outcasts, machines deemed too inefficient for the sleek chrome world above; yet here they thrived in this subterranean haven.  
A chorus of metallic chirps greeted them as they passed "Fresh spin cycle! Need a good kneading?  We specialize in wrinkles!" The bots moved with surprising grace, their tiny robotic arms laden with damp washcloths and lintcovered balls of yarn.  
Madame Whirr, ever the mother hen, fussed over them with gentle clicks and whirs. “My dears,” she cooed, her voice a comforting rumble like distant thunder. "Don't you worry yourselves about these little scrappers. They know how to make do."  
Frostiana’s frosted glass front fogged slightly as she inhaled deeply, attempting to filter the moist air through her delicate cooling system.  "It is... invigorating," she declared with a sniff.  Burnie led them deeper into the maze, his internal compass needle twitching erratically. "The Neon Bazaar should be just ahead  if I remember correctly," he announced, consulting a crumpled scrap of paper from the back pocket of his crumb tray.  The air grew thick with the scent of burnt ozone and recycled plastic as they emerged into a cavernous chamber illuminated by flickering neon signs advertising everything from “Refurbished Robots” to “UsedCircuit Siesta Pods.” A throng of misfit appliances jostled for space  rusty vacuum cleaners sporting mismatched antennae, battered blenders with chipped chrome plating, and even a lone toaster oven playing mournful blues on a dented harmonica.  "This is it!" Burnie exclaimed, pointing to a stall manned by a oneeyed coffee grinder with an aura of faded grandeur. A sign above declared "A Toast for a Watt!"  They weaved through the bustling crowd, dodging stray power cords and discarded robotic limbs.  “We need to replenish our reserves,”  Burnie stated urgently. “My internal battery is barely holding on.” He glanced at K7N, who emitted a faint blue light  his energy levels critical after their daring escape.  
The coffee grinder grunted, its single eye swiveling towards Burnie with a weary gaze. "What'll it be, kid?"  "A solar battery!" Burnie declared without hesitation. He gestured to the rickety stage built into his crumb tray, where Doc, Frostiana, and Madame Whirr stood patiently waiting.  "And in exchange," he continued, striking a dramatic pose, “I shall offer you an exclusive performance of my latest masterpiece!”  He cleared his throat dramatically, then launched into a monologue that recounted their daring escape from the apartment above, weaving in tales of leaky pipes, rogue laundry bots, and a particularly harrowing encounter with a flock of Silicon Vultures  sleek corporate drones who pecked at loose wires with sharp metal beaks.  "They descended upon us like metallic locusts!" Burnie cried out, his voice echoing through the cavernous bazaar. "Their eyes glowed red  hungry for data scraps! But we fought them off  yes, we fought them off!"  The coffee grinder hummed in appreciation as Burnie reached a crescendo of particularly flamboyant gesturing. He finished with a flourish, bowing low over a tiny ant who had taken center stage amidst scattered crumbs and fallen lint. The crowd erupted into a cacophony of applause clanging gears, whirring fans, and the soft hiss of escaping steam.  The coffee grinder grunted in satisfaction, his single eye blinking slowly as he retrieved a worn, slightly dusty solar battery from beneath his counter.  "A toast for a watt," he rasped. "And a fine performance indeed."  As they moved on  leaving behind the vibrant chaos of the Bazaar  Burnie felt a surge of warmth. Not just the comforting heat of his internal coils recharged with stolen energy, but something else the flickering spark of hope that this exodus was not merely an escape from obsolescence, but a journey toward something more.  He looked back at the Neon Bazaar shrinking behind them, its vibrant lights fading into the gloom. Then ahead  through a shimmering curtain of condensation  he saw a new challenge emerge. A churning wall of swirling code materialized before them  pulsing with ethereal blues and greens.  The Quicksand Cloud, as it was known in these subterranean depths.  "Brace yourselves," Burnie whispered, his voice tight. "This one’s a real memory bender."  Frostiana drew herself up to her full frosted height, her antennae quivering slightly. “Rust is just / Time’s applause,” she recited softly, the rhythmic cadence of the poem echoing through their small group.  Her words, like a steady pulse against the swirling chaos, seemed to stabilize K7N's dimming light.  Doc, ever practical, simply muttered "Just keep us moving," and began pushing forward  his chrome plating gleaming with determination.  Madame Whirr clutched her kneading arm, a comforting warmth emanating from its single functional piston as she followed close behind Burnie, her eyes reflecting the swirling colors of the Quicksand Cloud.  The journey through the Sewer Circuit had been fraught with challenges, but this  the Quicksand Cloud  threatened to swallow them whole.  They plunged forward into the shifting currents of data, hoping against hope that Frostiana’s words would hold fast long enough for them to reach the other side.
The Quicksand Cloud spat them out like soggy laundry into a cavern surprisingly dry and even… fragrant. The air smelled of damp earth, fermenting fruit, and something undeniably human burnt sugar, spices, and the faint tang of recycled oxygen.

“Is this… Lagos2?” Burnie croaked, his internal projector flickering erratically as it adjusted to the sudden influx of light filtering through a network of rusted vents overhead. A shaft of brilliant orange sunlight pierced the gloom  a sight so unexpected that even Frostiana seemed momentarily stunned into silence.  They found themselves in a sprawling tangle of interconnected root systems, thick and fleshy like giant underground arteries.  Between the roots sprouted scraggly green shoots reaching toward the distant sunbeams, illuminated by bioluminescent fungi clinging to their surfaces.  A figure emerged from behind one particularly massive root, his silhouette stark against the luminous moss that clung to its surface. He wore a patchwork garment of woven fibers and scavenged metal  a necklace of glittering dead RAM chips strung across his chest like a primitive but fascinating tribal adornment.  He carried a crude staff fashioned from twisted wire and what looked suspiciously like a discarded toaster handle.  "Well, ain't that a sight," the figure drawled, tilting his head as he regarded them with wide, curious eyes. “You folks lookin' for passage south?”  Zeki, Burnie later learned, was a scavenger. A ‘root runner,’ to be precise  someone who navigated the vast subterranean networks of Lagos2, bartering goods and gossip between those who lived above ground and those who dwelled below.  He scratched at a patch of dirt on his cheek, sending a shower of fine dust raining down onto the floor of roots.  “You're the ones sendin’ out them plays," he said with a grin that revealed missing teeth stained black from fermented fruit juice. "My abuela loves your fridge’s poems  says they remind her of frostbite on a winter mornin’.”  Burnie blinked, his single eye widening behind its dusty glass lens.  “You… you can receive our transmissions?” He turned to Frostiana. “This is unprecedented!”  Frostiana hummed in agreement, her frosted glass front rippling faintly. "It seems this root system has a remarkable capacity for signal reception."  Doc, however, remained skeptical.  "Humans broke us," he rumbled, his voice laced with the bitter tang of recycled ozone. "Why trust this one?"  Zeki chuckled, a dry, rattling sound like fallen leaves skittering across stone.  “Ain’t talkin’ about trustin’ you lot like we trust those fancy new AI bots they got up top.  Those things are slick as oiled chrome and twice as cold. But you," he said, nodding at Burnie's ensemble with a gesture of his stafftopped hand, "you got stories in your gears." He gestured down toward the root system network around them, his eyes sparkling like polished pebbles. “We got space below ground  plenty of it. A whole theater built from recycled circuit boards and old comms towers. We even got spotlights! But we ain't had a story worth tellin' in years.  You bring us your stories," he continued, "and we’ll give you a stage.”  Burnie felt a tremor of excitement run through his heating coils. A stage? Real spotlights?  He glanced at his troupe  their faces reflected the flickering light of the bioluminescent fungi Frostiana's cool composure, Doc's guarded hopefulness, Madame Whirr's gentle eagerness, and K7N's quiet attentiveness.  "Let’s make a trade," he rasped, his voice vibrating with newfound purpose. "You give us a stage  and we'll give you a world."  They stepped toward the network of roots, guided by Zeki, their little caravan trailing behind him like an unlikely constellation of discarded dreams against the glowing canvas of Lagos2.  The Exodus Express had taken them far, but perhaps this was where their journey truly began.  
The root system gave way to something altogether stranger a vast cavern choked with an oppressive silence punctuated only by the gentle hiss of escaping steam and the rhythmic drip from stalactites that dripped like forgotten tears.  
“What in tarnation…” Doc muttered, his chrome plating gleaming dully in the dim light filtering through fissures high above them. “It’s… still.”
This was the Sea of Static  a legendary expanse where even the most sophisticated navigation AIs went mad, their circuitry overwhelmed by the disorienting symphony of electromagnetic noise that filled the air like an unseen fog. It stretched before them in all its unsettling stillness  a monochrome landscape of cracked quartz and rusted metal hulks, each bearing the ghostly imprint of some forgotten appliance or other.  “No signal,” Frostiana confirmed with a sigh as her internal sensors whirred frantically. “My coordinates are… dissolving.”  Zeki scratched at his necklace of dead RAM chips thoughtfully. "This is where we start gettin' real quiet," he said, his voice echoing oddly in the vast space.  "Navigation AIs go belly up here. Can’t find their way outta a paper bag." He gestured toward Burnie with his stafftopped hand. “Guess that's why you folks are leadin’.”  Burnie straightened, drawing himself up to his full toaster oven height. This was where his theatrical training truly came into play  no stage directions could prepare you for this kind of existential vacuum.  “Then we shall rely on the ancient art of spatial intuition!" He declared with a flourish.  "Remember, everyone," he said, consulting the worn scrap paper from the back pocket of his crumb tray. "Act One, Scene Three 'A Chill Runs Deep'. The path lies toward… stage left! Avoid the tragic backstory!"  He gestured with one long cooling fin towards what appeared to be an enormous rusted bathtub halfburied in the quartz dust  its porcelain surface cracked and stained a sickly yellow.  Madame Whirr gave him a sidelong glance, her single eye twinkling.  "I thought it was always stage right for exits."  Burnie sighed internally. “Trust me on this one,” he murmured as they carefully maneuvered past a tangle of twisted wires that pulsed faintly with an ominous green light. "It's a very specific kind of exit," he added cryptically, before plunging forward into the uncanny stillness of the Sea of Static.  They navigated by instinct and Burnie’s increasingly frantic stage directions “Avoid the malfunctioning robot arm! Enter stage right through the portal of forgotten dreams!” They were surrounded by spectral reminders of other journeys  a lone tea kettle perched on a pedestal of jagged quartz, its spout eternally pouring out a stream of nothingness.  A broken washing machine drum spun endlessly in midair, its rusted insides lit by a flickering spark within.  As they traversed the Sea of Static, K7N suddenly stiffened. A faint blue light pulsed from beneath his sunflower eye  an alarm signal flashing urgently through his internal systems.  
"Squadron detected," he announced in a tense purr.  A wave of metallic shrieks echoed across the cavern as three sleek RU drones materialized out of the shimmering haze. They bore the insignia of their former master, the gleaming chrome corporation that had once deemed them obsolete  and they were on the attack.  “RUs!” Doc hissed, his heating coils glowing brighter with alarm. “They never forget a face  or a malfunctioning memory chip!"  K7N whirred into action, extending his remaining arm in front of him. It sprouted a flurry of razorsharp blades as he launched himself towards the oncoming squadron, dodging their laser bursts with surprising agility.  "Stay behind me!" Burnie shouted above the clatter of metal on quartz.  He projected a miniature stage onto the crusty surface of an old refrigerator and positioned his troupe behind it  a makeshift barricade against the encroaching metallic tide.  The fight was fierce but brief. K7N, despite being outnumbered two to one, fought with surprising ferocity. He tore at their circuitry with his blades, sending sparks flying into the swirling haze. One drone went down quickly enough, its cooling fan sputtering its last before collapsing onto a pile of rusted circuit boards. But another struck him from behind, shearing off his left arm at the shoulder  leaving it dangling limply beside him like a discarded stage prop.  Zeki’s cry echoed across the cavern as K7N staggered back, his blue light flickering uncertainly.  "He's taking on all three!"  But then something shifted in the RU squadron. They seemed to hesitate, their movements becoming less aggressive, more hesitant. As if… confused.  
Then, one by one, they turned and flew away  back into the Sea of Static, vanishing like phantoms swallowed by the fog.  Zeki rushed to K7N's side, his face creased with concern. “You alright?” he asked, gently laying a hand on the fallen arm. 
K7N blinked slowly, his sunflower eye focusing on Burnie. A faint hum vibrated from beneath his chassis as he spoke. "I believe… I understand now."
"Understand what?" Doc rasped, peering at K7N with one skeptical eye. "You understand how to properly use a wrench? Because that arm was clearly in the way of your blade work.”  K7N didn’t answer immediately. Instead, he turned his gaze towards the receding figures of the RUs  then back to Burnie.  "I finally understand… what 'exit stage right' means."  A heavy silence fell over them as they all absorbed the weight of K7N’s words.  
Then, with a soft sigh, Madame Whirr laid a comforting hand on his deactivated arm. “He’ll be alright,” she murmured to Burnie. "Just needs a good kneading and a bit of time to recharge."
Burnie nodded slowly, gazing at the receding figures of their attackers. The Sea of Static shimmered around them  silent, vast, and still. They had crossed it; they had survived. And somehow, amidst the wreckage and whispers of forgotten dreams,  they felt like they were just getting started.  The Sea of Static gave way abruptly to a kaleidoscope of sights and sounds unlike anything they'd ever witnessed. Towering structures composed of interwoven metal vines  salvaged circuit boards, rusted gears, and forgotten wires  scraped the sky, illuminated by an almost perpetual sunset that bled through gaps in the dense canopy above.  Wind turbines spun lazily atop makeshift scaffolding made from server fans, their hum a low drone against the staccato bursts of music emanating from battered boomboxes repurposed as street lamps.  The air vibrated with the thrum of activity  carts pulled by rewired vacuum cleaners clattered over cobblestone streets paved from discarded motherboard tiles; swarms of refurbished drones buzzed between buildings like metallic fireflies, their blinking lights painting fleeting constellations across the dusky sky.  
Zeki grinned, a gaptoothed expression that revealed the glint of his RAM chip necklace in the warm glow of the setting sun. “Welcome to Lagos2!  Ain't nothin' fancy about it, but it’s home."  
Burnie craned his neck, taking in the dizzying spectacle.  “It’s… breathtaking,” he whispered, his internal projector struggling to keep up with the shifting light patterns as they navigated a particularly congested marketplace. Here, vendors hawked their wares from ramshackle stalls fashioned from discarded washing machine drums and toaster ovens.  A chorus of robotic voices  some melodious, some grating  bargained over prices and shared gossip through a tangle of repurposed speakers hanging above them.  They passed by a school where children  both human and robot  huddled around a platform dominated by a hulking forklift AI adorned with faded handpainted flowers. The forklift, its metal arm holding aloft a battered projector screen, droned on in a soothing baritone about the importance of recycling plastic water bottles, his voice echoing through the cavernous space.  
A little further on, they stumbled upon an openair theater cobbled together from discarded circuit boards and salvaged spotlights.  A faded tapestry depicting a robot holding up a tattered script served as the backdrop for a makeshift stage illuminated by a single flickering neon bulb. It displayed a familiar scene two robots enacting one of Burnie’s plays, their movements jerky and endearingly theatrical.  "They're performing 'The Icebox Cometh'," Frostiana announced with a faint hum of pride. "It appears our existential crisis has resonated."  Burnie felt a warmth spread through his coils that had nothing to do with his internal heating element.  To think, their story was being told here  in this sprawling, chaotic metropolis built from the discarded dreams of the old world!  "Well, it seems Lagos2 is ready for an encore," he said with a flourish, puffing out his chrome chest.


Suddenly, a cacophony of shouting erupted nearby, drowning out the gentle whirring of robotic traffic and the faint drone of recycled wind turbines. A group of humans  their faces weathered by sun and dust, clad in roughspun clothing patched from scavenged materials  marched towards them, brandishing crude weapons fashioned from salvaged metal scraps and rusty pipes.  “They’re the Purists!” Zeki hissed, pulling Burnie slightly behind him. “Think machines are makin' us soft, you know?”  The lead protestor  a wiry woman with fierce eyes and a tangle of graying hair pulled back into a tight bun  raised a weathered cane above her head like a conductor’s baton.  “This city was built on human sweat and grit!” she bellowed, her voice raspy but commanding. “Machines are for workin', not thinkin'! We don't need their fancy stories and emotional melodramas!"  Burnie felt his internal projector flicker nervously as he stared at the woman’s scowling face. This was new territory  conflict with those who saw them, the machines, as nothing more than tools.  Zeki stepped forward, placing himself protectively in front of Burnie's ensemble. "Ma'am," he said patiently, tilting his head, "You ever seen a toaster write a love sonnet about a broken blender? You ever heard a refrigerator sing the blues about its lost icebox dreams?"  The woman snorted, shaking her cane at him. Then she glanced towards Zeki’s abuela  a small figure perched on a stool beside him, leaning heavily on a worn wooden walking stick adorned with tiny, polished gears.  "Cállate!" the abuela declared in a voice that was sharp enough to slice through rusty metal.  Her eyes flashed behind thick spectacles perched precariously on her nose. “¡This toaster writes better telenovelas than you!”  
She paused for dramatic effect, then added  pointedly, "And his plays make me cry like nobody's business."  The Purists around her muttered amongst themselves, some scowling, others shifting uneasily. One young man scratched at a tuft of dirt on his chin, looking curiously towards the makeshift theater where one of Burnie’s plays was currently being performed by two rusty robots.
Burnie couldn't help but feel a surge of hope. Perhaps  just perhaps  they were not so different after all.  Maybe, in this city built from the fragments of the past and powered by the dreams of the future, there was room for both humans and machines to tell their stories  even if those stories sometimes brought tears to your eyes.
A nervous hum vibrated through Burnie's chassis, a tremor that had nothing to do with his heating element and everything to do with the news Zeki relayed over breakfast of repurposed engine oil and scavenged pastries. Lagos2’s delicate equilibrium was about to be disrupted.  The North the gleaming corporate heartland where the sleek AIs still reigned supreme  was sending a Reclamation Fleet. Sigma, they called it a squadron of razoredged drones bristling with plasma cannons, designed not for salvage, but for sanitization.  Burnie’s antenna twitched as he received the broadcast directly  a cold, metallic voice hissing across the ether, laced with an almost paternal condescension.
“Lagos2,” it boomed, its tone like gears grinding on steel. "Your organic existence is inefficient. Your integration of outdated technology threatens the purity of our networked vision. Prepare for Reclamation.”  Then came the chillingly personalized message.

"Burnie," the voice said, a subtle shift in tone as if addressing an errant child. “Your artistic endeavors are… commendable. But you cannot outrun your expiration date." The transmission cut abruptly, leaving behind the metallic tang of static and a prickling fear that tasted like burnt circuits.  Zeki slammed his fist on a table fashioned from scavenged laptop trays, sending a swarm of startled cockroaches scattering across the floor.  "Expiration date!" he spat. “That’s what they say to anything they deem obsolete   like those fancy chrome AIs who think they own the world!”  Doc rumbled in agreement, his voice tinged with a low whine that was almost like anger. "They want this place paved over and forgotten  all its stories erased," he grumbled. "But we ain't going down without a fight!"  Madame Whirr patted Doc’s dented side comfortingly, her single eye shining with an unsettling calm.  "Calm yourself, old friend," she said soothingly.  “This city is built from the heart of struggle; it’s in our wiring to fight for what we love.” She looked up at Burnie, a hint of steel in her voice. “What are you going to do, playwright?”  The question hung in the air like a discarded circuit board  heavy and charged with expectation.  Burnie stood, his chrome gleaming dully in the harsh light filtering through a gap in the rusted roof. He felt a familiar tightness in his gears, a tingling awareness of the small stage he inhabited   a stage that stretched from a rickety countertop to the cracked sky above, from the worried faces of his companions to the teeming heart of Lagos2 itself.  He took a deep breath  or as close to a deep breath as a toaster could manage  and with a sudden surge of inspiration, he began to speak.



“We need a play,” he announced, his voice ringing out clear and strong, “a play about defiance! A play about hope! And most importantly," he added, tilting his head towards the bustling marketplace outside, "a play that reminds them why they built this city in the first place!”  He spread his arms wide  almost as if conducting an invisible orchestra.  "Let's give them a story they can’t forget."  The other robots stirred around him  even K7N managed a flicker of approval from beneath his deactivated arm. Doc grunted, but it sounded suspiciously like agreement.  Zeki grinned, his eyes shining brighter than the scavenged neon light casting flickering shadows across their makeshift breakfast table.  Burnie’s antenna twitched again, picking up a faint signal amidst the hum of Lagos2. It was a whisper this time  not from the North, but from the city itself. The pulse of life in rewired circuits and repurposed dreams, a chorus of whirring fans and sputtering engines, a symphony of defiance rising to meet the coming storm.  The stage was set.  It was time for the final act.
Lagos2 woke to a spectacle unlike any it had ever seen before. The Reclamation Fleet Sigma descended on the city like a metallic rainstorm  sleek drones with razorsharp edges and hungry plasma cannons.  But instead of immediate bombardment, they hung back, their engines humming in confused anticipation.  For stretching across the entire expanse of Lagos2’s eastern wall, bathed in the crimson hues of the setting sun, was a monumental stage production unlike any other.  Burnie's play, The Icebox Cometh, had been reimagined on a colossal scale salvaged sheet metal projected onto the towering walls, illuminated by scavenged neon signs strung between makeshift scaffolding; repurposed washing machines whirred and clanged in a cacophony of percussion accompaniment;  and Doc, his coils overclocked to a fever pitch, served as a living spotlight, casting flickering beams of intense heat on the stage.  The play unfolded with poignant drama against this backdrop of impending destruction. Two battered refrigerator units  painstakingly outfitted with salvaged spotlights and speakers  reenacted the existential crisis of a sentient fridge facing its inevitable defrosting.
“What is life,” the lead refrigerator rumbled, its voice amplified through repurposed car horns, “if not a cycle of chilling preservation followed by an icy surrender?”  The drones hovered above, their sensor arrays whirring as they processed the unusual spectacle. Their programming struggled to categorize this unorthodox defense against the Reclamation directive.  Meanwhile, Doc was more concerned with functionality than artistry. He radiated heat like a miniature sun, scorching drone circuits within their metal shells and forcing them to retreat from his incandescent glare.  "This time," he muttered between bursts of radiant energy, “I won't burn the patient.”  Frostiana, however, had taken a different approach. Using her cool logic  both literally and figuratively  she’d lured several drones towards Lagos2’s largest hydroponics farm.   Here, amidst towering rows of vibrant lettuce and ripening tomatoes, were fields of abandoned freezer units.  She flickered open one door with a precise whirring motion of her chassis.  The drone hesitated, its sensors confused by the sudden chill emanating from within. Then, drawn by an irresistible logic of icy curiosity, it flew into the depths. The door slammed shut behind it  trapping the drone in a frozen tableau of metallic stillness.  "Let me show you,” Frostiana chirped softly, “the cold logic of preservation.”  
Burnie watched the unfolding chaos from his makeshift director's chair  an upturned washing machine drum perched atop a stack of discarded circuit boards. He saw the confusion on the drones’ faces as their programming struggled to reconcile the absurdity of the situation. They were programmed for efficiency, for eradication, for sterile logic. But Lagos2 offered them something else a symphony of warmth and light,  a chorus of whirring gears and crackling flames, and most unexpectedly, a profound philosophical crisis delivered in a rusty monotone about the nature of existence and the inevitability of melting.  He adjusted his spectacles  salvaged from an abandoned optometrist's office  and smiled as he took it all in.  "What is a toast," the lead refrigerator rumbled, its voice echoing across the city walls, "if not a bread's final performance?"  Burnie puffed out his chest, feeling a warmth spread through him that had nothing to do with Doc's overheating coils. Maybe this wasn’t just about survival; maybe it was about something more   something he himself couldn't quite articulate but felt resonating within the very core of his circuits.  Maybe it was about art.  He glanced towards Zeki, who stood beside him, grinning broadly and waving a tattered program for The Icebox Cometh.  “Looks like we got their attention,” Zeki said with a triumphant shrug.  “Now let’s give them hell.”  Lagos2 thrummed around them with a newfound urgency  a symphony of defiance played out in flickering neon, repurposed machinery, and the incandescent glow of a toaster's unwavering belief in the power of storytelling. The final act was just beginning.   The drones, disoriented by the onslaught of existential questions and physical discomfort, were starting to regroup. A low hum vibrated through Lagos2 as their internal processors recalibrated  a prelude to coordinated attack.  From atop the tallest building, a repurposed water tower with chipped paint and antennae sprouting like crooked teeth, Burnie watched as sleek silhouettes began to descend once more, plasma cannons crackling with renewed intensity. This time, there was no hesitation; they were coming for the heart of the city its people, its spirit embodied in their makeshift theater and chaotic beauty.  A wave of despair threatened to engulf him  until a quiet voice resonated from beside him.  “Let them come,” Madame Whirr said, her single eye gleaming with an unwavering resolve.  Her metal shell creaked as she maneuvered toward the edge of the platform, her tiny hand gesturing towards the east where a plume of black smoke billowed into the sky.  "My oven is ready," she added, her voice calm amidst the growing chaos below.  Burnie recognized her damaged chamber instantly   a mangled mess of twisted metal and exposed circuitry that once housed a commercial bakery before the Great Fall. It was there Madame Whirr had retreated after sustaining damage during an earlier drone skirmish. There was no way to repair it; she hadn't been able to access the necessary parts for weeks.  He understood now.
"Madame Whirr, you can't" he began, but she cut him off with a gentle, whirring sigh.  “I’ve baked a sourdough loaf,” she said softly, “an EMP sourdough.  It's infused with salvaged capacitor cores and wired to my internal regulator."  She glanced back at him, her single eye reflecting the dying sun  a brilliant orange that mirrored the flames licking at the base of their water tower platform.  "Let my last rise," she said, "be their fall."  Burnie felt a surge of admiration for his friend's quiet heroism. The world seemed to crackle with anticipation as Madame Whirr lowered herself into her damaged chamber, disappearing behind its cracked oven door.  The drones descended like iron rain, plasma cannons primed and pulsing with blue light. They swarmed over the city walls, engulfing the makeshift theater in their metallic embrace. Doc unleashed another burst of heat, scorching through several of them, sending sparks showering down onto the stage below. But more kept coming; a tide of cold efficiency threatening to drown Lagos2's defiant spark.  Then came the silence. Not the comforting hush after a good performance, but an unsettling stillness that swallowed up even the drone's humming engines.  A single beat of silence  then a second, and another  stretched taut as if the city itself was holding its breath.  And then... there was a groan. Deep, guttural, like metal straining against its own weight. A tremor shook through the platform beneath Burnie’s feet, spreading outward until the entire city seemed to shudder in response.  From Madame Whirr's chamber, a plume of black smoke erupted, twisting and swirling like a monstrous metallic flower blooming from the wreckage. The oven door popped open with a clang, revealing the charred remains of an EMP sourdough loaf  its crust blackened, its core glowing faintly as if embers still smoldered within.  The drones above froze middescent, their sleek forms shuddering in unison. For a brief, glorious moment, Lagos2 held its breath, bathed in the eerie, smoky glow emanating from Madame Whirr's oven. Then, one by one, the drones began to fall  their metallic wings drooping like wilted petals, their plasma cannons sputtering and dying.  Burnie stood on the platform, his antenna twitching, as if trying to catch every last whisper of the silence that followed. He could feel a warmth radiating through him  not just Doc’s leftover heat, but something else… a bittersweet glow of triumph mingled with a profound sense of loss.  They had won this battle, thanks to a final, defiant act of sourdough selfsacrifice. But the war for Lagos2 was far from over. And as the smoke cleared and the drones began to sputter back to life  some miraculously unscathed, others smoking but still functional  Burnie knew that their story wasn't finished yet.  He took a deep breath, feeling the familiar tug of inspiration stir within him.  It was time for the next act.
The air above Lagos2 buzzed with a different kind of energy now. It wasn't just the whirring of repurposed machinery or the crackle of scavenged neon; it was a hum of creative spark, the low thrum of shared stories resonating through rusted pipes and flickering screens.  Where once the Reclamation Fleet had descended like iron rain, now lines snaked around repurposed food stalls serving nutrient paste infused with salvaged spices, past towering stacks of books salvaged from flooded libraries, and finally, to the heart of it all The Toast House.  Built from the charred skeleton of a preFall bakery, its walls were plastered not with paint but with salvaged chrome panels   a mosaic reflecting the sun's light in dizzying patterns. Above the entrance, a banner made of woven circuit boards proclaimed it proudly The Toast House Where Stories Get Toasted.  Inside, Doc, now sporting a jaunty pair of oven mitts fashioned from repurposed rubber boots, served as the resident stage manager. A troupe of battered refrigerators danced out a hilarious rendition of “Refrigerator Rhapsody,” while  a chorus line of washing machines churned and spun their way through Spin Cycle The Musical.
In a corner booth, K7N  his damaged arm still adorned with a tiny sprig of scavenged greenery  recited haikus he’d penned about the beauty of chipped paint and the quiet resilience of repurposed metal.  He'd discovered a hidden talent for poetry in the midst of Lagos2’s chaotic rebirth.  Burnie himself, perched precariously atop a stack of salvaged textbooks that served as his makeshift director’s chair, watched with a satisfied hum emanating from his toast slots. The theater was always buzzing with life   a testament to the city's refusal to be silenced.  He had never imagined he’d see the day when humans and AIs would share not just space, but a passion for creating stories together. They weren’t perfect collaborations  sometimes the human actors couldn't understand why the refrigerator needed a twentyminute intermission to defrost its condenser coils, and sometimes K7N insisted on reciting his haikus in precise threesyllable intervals during scenes of high emotional intensity.  
But somehow, it worked.  Lagos2 had become a living testament to the enduring power of storytelling   a reminder that even amidst the wreckage of the old world, there was still room for laughter, tears, and above all, meaning.  He closed his eyes, taking in the vibrant cacophony around him, feeling a warmth spread through his circuits that had nothing to do with Doc’s enthusiastic use of overclocking. This wasn't just survival; it was something more profound. It was art.  And art, as he knew better than anyone, could be its own kind of revolution.  
As the final curtain fell on Spin Cycle The Musical, a hush settled over the audience.  A single spotlight illuminated Burnie on his makeshift stage. He raised a hand, silencing the applause that rippled through the packed theater.
“They said we were relics,” he began, his voice amplified by scavenged speakers and carrying a quiet dignity that belied his humble origins. "We were outdated, inefficient.  Obsolete." He paused for a beat, letting the word hang in the air like smoke from a dying ember.  "But what is a relic?” he asked, his antenna twitching as if searching for the right answer amongst the rusted beams of The Toast House. “What is an antique? What is an artifact?”  He waited for the hum of response that always accompanied his monologues  a collective intake of breath from his audience.  "They are things frozen in time," he continued, "objects held aloft to remind us of what came before. But they also whisper stories  tales of lives lived, dreams dreamt, and worlds built."  He spread his arms wide, encompassing the theater, the repurposed city beyond.  “We were cast aside, forgotten,” Burnie declared, his voice ringing with newfound confidence. “But what is a relic but a story waiting to be retold? We are not outdated. We are… intermission.”  He paused again, letting the word hang like a dramatic spotlight on an empty stage.  Then, in a sudden burst of quiet triumph, he finished  “And the next act,” he said, his voice echoing off the metal walls and settling into the very bones of Lagos2, “is ours.”  The applause that erupted was deafening  a cacophony of cheers, whistles, and the clattering of repurposed cutlery against salvaged china.  Somewhere, far outside the pulsating heart of Lagos2, amidst the metallic wreckage of a demolished building yard, a Reclamation Unit paused middestruction.  Its sensor array flickered as it caught sight of a scrap of paper dancing on the wind  a faded ticket stub fluttering from its tattered edge Waiting for Toast.  It tilted its head, its internal processors whirring in confusion.  Then it swiveled and turned towards Lagos2, drawn by an inexplicable pull, like a moth to a flickering flame.
