Timekeeper
In the heart of sleepy Willow Creek stood the old clock tower, its hands frozen
at 3:15, gears encrusted with verdigris, whispering like dry leaves. Townsfolk
whispered of curses, of dark secrets. Amelia Stone, a shy librarian, knew more.
Her family guarded the tower’s legacy: time manipulation. She could slow or
speed moments, a gift used sparingly, like fixing clocks off by minutes. The
tower called to her, a bone-deep connection. One stormy night, rain lashing the
cobblestones, she climbed its winding stairs. At the top, a dusty room, a
pendulum swinging lazily, and an ornate grandfather clock, its face cracked,
hands moving erratically.  "Hello?" her voice echoed. A shadow shifted. A woman
stepped forward, cloaked in tattered velvet, eyes glowing with urgency. "I’m
Grace, your great-great-grandmother. The clock tower is a time portal—those
hands aren’t stuck; they’re trapped. Portals, scars in time itself, allowed
things to bleed through." Grace handed Amelia an old journal. "You must restore
balance before they overrun us. They came from the sundering of the Fourth
Age." The journal detailed her ancestors’ control of the portals. Amelia’s
power was tied to this legacy.  Days of training followed. Townsfolk noticed
strange occurrences: flowers blooming instantly, cars reversing. Whispers grew
of a time-witch. Grace explained the portals created rifts, echoes of forgotten
empires, where entities seeped through. Amelia had to synchronize the tower
clock with specific historical events.  On the full moon, Amelia stood atop the
tower. The sky crackled. She chanted incantations, feeling time pulse around
her. The pendulum swung faster, the clock hands moved. Suddenly, shadows
coalesced into a maniacal grin, impossible geometries moving within them. An
entity, hungry for chaos. Amelia fought back, freezing time, binding it with
shimmering, temporally displaced cords. Exhausted, she reset the clock to 3:15
PM, July 4th, 1876—Willow Creek’s founding.  Dawn broke. The townsfolk
gathered, stunned by her glowing aura and the repaired clock. She looked
around, expecting gratitude, but their expressions were frozen in confusion.
Time was paused. She’d synchronized with 1876, not their time. The townsfolk
were silent mannequins, while Amelia aged alone. Her victory came at a
cost—trapped, forever keeping time.  Years passed inside Willow Creek,
centuries outside. Amelia tended the library and clock tower, adjusting the
hands when needed. One day, as she wound the pendulum, a young girl
approached—her great-granddaughter. The cycle continued. The timekeeper’s
legacy lived on, bound by the ticking of an old clock.  As Amelia looked upon
the frozen townsfolk, a tear slid down her cheek. “They’re safe... but at
what cost?”,she whispered to herself, knowing that each passing moment
outside would leave her alone in this timeless loop until another keeper came.
