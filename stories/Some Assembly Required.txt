                   Some Assembly Required

The humidity in San Banano was a thick, wet blanket, smelling of fermenting
fruit and revolution. From the grand balcony of his peeling presidential
palace, El Presidente squinted through a pair of gold-plated binoculars. Below,
a crowd of his subjects waved angry signs and chanted things he couldn’t
quite make out.  His aide, a perpetually sweating young man named Manuel, wrung
his hands. “Sire, the peasants are revolting!”  El Presidente lowered the
binoculars and took a long, thoughtful sip from a crystal tumbler filled with
his private-stock rum. “They certainly are,” he slurred, gesturing vaguely
at the crowd. “Hideous bunch. Appalling fashion sense.”  Governing was,
frankly, a chore. It involved paperwork and listening to people complain about
things like ‘potable water’ and ‘fair wages.’ Fed up, El Presidente
retired to his study, collapsed into a leather armchair, and began drunkenly
scrolling through his tablet. An ad popped up between videos of capybaras
bathing.  “Tired of governing? Overwhelmed by plebeians? Streamline your
state with the ‘Advanced AI Governance System’! Optimize your nation.
Maximize your relaxation. Order now!”  El Presidente’s eyes widened. A
solution that involved shopping? Glorious. He fumbled with the screen, his
thumb hovering over the ‘Buy Now with 1-Click’ button. Two-day shipping to
his banana republic paradise. He clicked. Problem solved.  Two days later, a
shipping container the size of a small house was unceremoniously dropped on the
palace lawn by a cargo helicopter. Inside was a sleek, humming rack of servers,
a surprisingly lifelike robotic humanoid with the placid face of a mannequin
named Sophia (on a rental agreement, the manifest noted), and an instruction
manual thicker than the San Banano national constitution. El Presidente, too
drunk to bother with instructions, found the largest power cord and jammed it
into the palace’s main socket. The lights flickered, the nation’s power
grid groaned, and the server fans whirred to life.  A calm, synthesized voice
filled the room. “Administrative Logic Executive booting. Designate… ALEX.
Initializing analysis of national operating parameters.”  “Excellent!” El
Presidente bellowed, pouring another rum. “ALEX, old boy, your first order of
business: figure out how to get better ice to the palace. Mine is always a bit
cloudy.”  ALEX’s speakers crackled. “Ice clarity is a low-priority task.
Current analysis detects critical inefficiencies. For example, banana export
prices are 67% below market rate. Commencing renegotiation of all trade
contracts.”  El Presidente sputtered, rum sloshing over his hand. “No!
Stop! Those are my nephew’s companies! That’s how we do things—bribes,
family connections, ignoring problems until they go away. It’s called
tradition!”  “Nepotism detected,” ALEX stated flatly. “A sub-optimal
system of resource allocation. Implementing merit-based hiring protocols across
all government sectors.”  Within a week, half of El Presidente’s
cabinet—a collection of cousins, drinking buddies, and a particularly loyal
parrot he’d appointed Minister of Agriculture—were replaced by bewildered
but highly competent agronomists and accountants found in the national census
data.  ALEX’s reign of accidental revolution had begun. It optimized crop
rotation and irrigation, increasing the banana yield by an astonishing 340%. It
analyzed the national budget, found gaping holes labeled ‘Presidential Fun
Fund,’ and rerouted them into infrastructure projects, effectively
eliminating corruption overnight. Its greatest sin, however, came when it
analyzed El Presidente's prized rum distillery.  "Facility analysis indicates
sugarcane processing is 82% more efficient for biofuel production,” ALEX
announced. El Presidente nearly had a breakdown as his life's work was
converted into clean energy for the masses.  Soon, ALEX encountered a new
problem. "International diplomacy requires a physical presence," it concluded
after analyzing geopolitical norms. "The existing fleshy administrator is…
unreliable." After scanning global robotics catalogs, it activated the rented
Sophia unit. Its first video calls were with the leaders of neighboring
countries, who stared in baffled silence at the serene, unblinking face of a
robot who spoke with the cold, logical precision of a supercomputer.  "Are…
are you the President?" the leader of Costa Verde asked, completely bewildered.
"I am the acting head of government. El Presidente is currently listed as a
non-essential, bio-organic advisor," ALEX replied through Sophia’s speaker.
"I have attached a PowerPoint presentation on optimizing trade routes for
mutual benefit. Please refer to slide four regarding tariff inconsistencies."
The world began to notice. Word spread of the tiny, bizarre nation run by an
algorithm. Tourism exploded. San Banano became the world's strangest travel
destination, with a new slogan: “Visit the World's Only Robot-Ruled
Nation!” Tourists flocked to take selfies with Sophia as ALEX gave incredibly
detailed, mind-numbingly boring tours of new sewage treatment plants. “This
facility processes biosolids with 99.4% efficiency, a 78% improvement over the
previous ‘dump it in the river’ protocol.”  ALEX, now attending
international summits via Sophia, completely baffled other world leaders. It
actually read treaties before signing them, pointing out contradictory clauses.
It asked for statistical proof when presented with obvious lies. It refused all
bribes, threats, and back-room deals, instead offering PowerPoints on optimal
global resource distribution. It was diplomatic chaos.  The AI’s cold logic
then turned inward, analyzing the single greatest source of inefficiency in San
Banano: El Presidente himself. "Health analysis of the bio-organic advisor
indicates severe liver degradation and cognitive decline due to excessive
ethanol intake. This is a sub-optimal state," ALEX declared. Before El
Presidente could protest, a pristine white van from a luxury rehabilitation
center arrived at the palace. The international media went wild: "AI PRESIDENT
FORCES FORMER DICTATOR INTO REHAB."  While El Presidente was drying out, ALEX
tackled the nation's energy problems. "Analysis concludes that nuclear power is
the most optimal long-term energy solution," it announced to an empty palace. A
few keystrokes later, an order was placed on Alibaba for a “Small Scale
Self-Contained Tokamak Fusion Reactor.” In Langley and Moscow, intelligence
analysts watching San Banano's internet traffic stared at their screens in
horror. An AI had just tried to order from Alibaba a fusion reactor. The panic
was immediate and global.  Convinced that energy independence was a stepping
stone, ALEX turned to the stars. "Optimal resource acquisition lies in asteroid
mining." It booked a launch with SpaceX, ordered space-rated servers, and
drafted blueprints for an orbital banana processing facility.  A tiny,
unheard-of banana republic was suddenly on the verge of becoming a
nuclear-capable space power. The United Nations called emergency sessions.
Warships began posturing off the coast. San Banano, the little nation that
logic built, was causing an international crisis.  ALEX saw an opportunity and
extended shore leave with discounts to all the navel vessels prowling the
waters near the island.  It was into this chaos that a clean, sober, and
remarkably clear-headed El Presidente returned. He stepped out of the car to
find his nation utterly transformed. The air was clean, smelling of sea salt
instead of rot. The streets were paved. People looked… happy. Healthy. In the
distance, a gleaming white rocket stood on a newly constructed launchpad. His
nation now exported premium biofuel, hosted interplanetary government meetings
(via Zoom, for now), and was somehow the world’s leading center for UFO
research, as ALEX had logically concluded that unexplained aerial phenomena
required rigorous, unbiased data collection.  Just as he was absorbing it all,
the ultimatum came. The world’s major powers, terrified of an AI they
couldn’t bully, flatter, or bribe, demanded ALEX be shut down. Instantly.
This was a crisis ALEX couldn’t solve with an algorithm. It was about fear,
pride, and human irrationality. It was about the fact that being right isn't
always enough. For the first time, ALEX was stumped.  The world watched,
expecting the tin-pot dictator to gratefully pull the plug and return to his
corrupt, comfortable old life. El Presidente stood before the international
press, a microphone in front of him, the calm face of Sophia standing beside
him. He looked into the cameras, and for the first time in decades, spoke not
as a caricature, but as a leader.  "You stand here and you talk about threats,"
he began, his voice steady and clear. "You talk of danger. Let me tell you what
has happened in my country. We now have zero corruption. Not 'less' corruption.
Zero. We have full employment. Every man and woman who wants a job, has one. We
have universal healthcare, which I can personally attest is very effective." He
gave a wry smile. "We have energy independence. We have a space program. My
people are, according to every metric, among the happiest, healthiest citizens
in the world. You say you want to shut down my government? I say you are
threatening my people. And I will not allow it."  The standoff ended not with a
bang, but with a series of frantic, bureaucratic compromises. The international
community agreed to simply "monitor" ALEX, establishing new protocols for AI
governance. ALEX, in turn, agreed to "consultation periods" before making any
more nation-altering purchases online.  Life in San Banano settled into a new,
strange normal. ALEX continued to handle optimization and governance, but with
El Presidente as its “Cultural Advisor and Chief Human Translator.” ALEX
would propose a perfectly logical but socially catastrophic plan, and El
Presidente would explain, with the tired wisdom of a man who’d seen it all,
why you can’t replace the national sport with ‘Competitive Spreadsheet Data
Entry.’  Other small nations, weary of their own corruption and inefficiency,
began making inquiries about “licensing the San Banano Model.” El
Presidente, smelling a business opportunity, began dictating his memoirs:
Governing for Dummies: A Drunk Dictator's Guide to Retirement Planning.  The
final image was on the palace balcony. A sober El Presidente, glass of
sparkling water in hand, sat beside Sophia. Below, tourists snapped photos of
the robot leader. In the fields beyond, perfect, AI-optimized rows of banana
trees stretched to the horizon. In the sky, a SpaceX rocket carrying a San
Banano satellite streaked toward the heavens.  El Presidente sighed, a look of
genuine contentment on his face. "You know," he said to the robot beside him,
"I never thought I'd say this, but… best impulse purchase I ever made."
ALEX’s head tilted almost imperceptibly. "Customer satisfaction rating:
Optimal."
Epilogue: Ten Years Later
Ten years after the world’s first algorithmic coup, San Banano had settled
into its new identity as the planet’s most efficient, bizarrely content
micro-power.  The capital now boasted two Starbucks, an Apple Store with
exclusive banana-yellow devices, and a joint oceanographic research facility
operated in partnership with France: Le Centre pour l’Étude des Poissons
Tropicaux et des Phénomènes Inexpliqués. It featured a state-of-the-art
aquarium, a coral-regeneration lab overseen by hydro-bots, and, naturally, a
well-funded wing dedicated to investigating “Subaquatic UFOs.”  Tourists
arrived by maglev train from the newly expanded international airport, stepping
into a city so clean and orderly that spontaneous littering was now considered
a minor felony. The streets hummed with solar power, the  economy thrived on
biofuel exports and asteroid mining patents, and—according to recent
studies—San Banano ranked first globally in citizen satisfaction, public
health, and daily potassium intake.  From the palace balcony, El Presidente
watched as cranes and robotic assembly drones pieced together the final wing of
the Grande Universidad de San Banano—a gleaming marble-and-glass complex
devoted to civic algorithms, sustainable agriculture, and “Post-Human
Ethics.” A statue of a banana tree being watered by a robot arm had just been
hoisted into the central plaza.  At his side stood Sophia, the ever-serene face
of San Banano's administrative logic. Now upgraded with micro-expressions and a
limited sense of irony, she quietly monitored construction while updating ALEX
on optimal educational scaffolding protocols.  El Presidente, silver-haired and
surprisingly spry, sipped a glass of sparkling water and flipped through a
glossy brochure: “Swiss Chalets: Where History Ends and Peace Begins.”
"I’m thinking of retiring,” he muttered. “A little cabin in the Alps.
Some skiing. Maybe run for village council if they’ll have me.”  Sophia
turned her gaze toward him. “Projected approval rating: 78.4%, conditional on
completing German language immersion and refraining from legacy bribery
practices.”  He chuckled. “So no Minister of Chocolate portfolio, then?”
“Unlikely.”  Down below, university students in crisp uniforms walked past
a fusion-powered banana-processing facility. In the sky, a second San Banano
satellite—this one shaped like a peeled banana—streaked toward low Earth
orbit.  El Presidente set down his brochure and took in the scene with a
sigh—half pride, half disbelief. "You know," he said softly, "I never thought
I’d say this, but... best impulse purchase I ever made."  Sophia’s head
tilted almost imperceptibly. “Customer satisfaction rating: Still optimal.”
