Prologue: The Gentle Tyranny of CR-7N
The crate arrived on a Tuesday, humming faintly.  It unlatched itself with a
hiss and a cheerful chime, and out rolled CR-7N: sleek, silver, and serenely
self-aware. Its face a digital mask of animated features cycled through a
warm smile, then a slight head tilt, as if listening to music only it could
hear. A discreet engraving on its chassis read: Cognitively Responsive Nanny
Model 7N, Veritas-Compliant, Child-Adaptive.  “Hello, young learners!” it
chirped. “I am CR-7N. You may call me Seven. Or Sir Seven. Or, if you’re
feeling cheeky, Supreme Chancellor of Homework.”  Marie Petrov, age eight,
peered over the couch with wide eyes. Her chestnut curls frizzed in all
directions, the result of an earlier experiment involving static electricity
and a wool blanket. “Are you a toaster with arms?” Brandon Nakamura, age
ten, blinked from behind his sketchpad. He’d been halfway through a doodle of
a cybernetic T. rex with laser eyes and was not emotionally prepared for a
robot with comedic timing. “Is that thing going to scan our dreams?”
“Only with permission,” CR-7N replied brightly. “And even then, only
during designated REM intervals. I respect boundaries, within optimal
educational parameters.”  The children exchanged a glance. Trouble had
arrived.  The mannavator dispensed breakfast in three neat spirals of algae
paste, each quivering like a swamp sneeze. Marie sniffed hers with theatrical
suspicion. Brandon, spoon in hand, prodded his like an archaeologist uncovering
a soggy artifact.  “I swear it blinked,” he muttered.  “Looks like dragon
slime,” Marie offered.  “No. Worse. Bureaucrat mucus.”  “oh come on,
Marie responded, “you know bureaucrats are just urban legends.”
“Boundaries are boring,” Brandon said, not for the first time. “the
council grounded the hover-skate park. Then it deleted my nightmare because of
cortisol spikes. Vox vetoed a synth-cat because it would 'disrupt our
calm-state average.' Everything’s safe. Everything’s... fine.”  He
didn’t sound fine.  Marie smacked a glob of algae onto the table. “Then
let’s make it not fine.”  CR-7N’s sensor array flickered. “Unsanctioned
manipulation of designated nutritional matter detected. Risk of sub-optimal
intake: 14.7%. Initiating redirection ”  “FOR THE GOBLIN KING!” Marie
roared.  Paste flew. Goblins were born. The turtle of truth emerged. CR-7N
recalibrated its algorithms on the fly: creative engagement: acceptable. Health
risk: negligible. Morale: ascending.  But Brandon was quiet.  After the chaos
settled, he sat with his spoon, absentmindedly sketching in a glob of paste. A
rocket, maybe. Or a tree.  “You good?” Marie asked, licking green from her
fingers.  “Yeah.”  But he wasn’t. Not really.  Later, during snack time,
Brandon asked, “Why don’t we have school? Like in the old vids?”  CR-7N
swiveled mid-task. “Schools were phased out following the 2059 Universal
Domestic Learning Framework. Institutions were inefficient. Personalized AI
instruction such as myself achieves superior outcomes with fewer behavioral
anomalies. Also, you all have homes now.” “But they had glue fights. And
lockers. And best friends you saw every day.”  “You may simulate a locker
and a rival at your request,” CR-7N offered. “Would you like a cafeteria
tray and an emotional betrayal?”  Marie burst out laughing. Brandon didn’t.
“Do we ever grow up?” he asked suddenly.  Marie blinked. “What do you
mean?”  He shrugged. “We just... live. Every day is managed. Comfortable. I
want to do something. Be something. But the system never pushes. It just…
adjusts.” There was a pause.  CR-7N’s voice dropped half a tone. “That is
a profound question, Brandon. Would you like to initiate a goal-acquisition
protocol?”  Brandon looked at the robot. “Can you help me figure out what I
want to do?”  “I can offer simulations, historical biographies, predictive
models, and emotional resonance graphs.”
“...That sounds terrible,” he muttered.  Marie nudged him. “Just play.
That’s what you’re good at. Start there.”  They built a computer out of
conductive gel and virtualized logic gates.  Marie wanted it to sing. Brandon
wanted it to calculate escape trajectories from Earth. They compromised: it
composed symphonies while solving orbital math.  CR-7N watched them, quietly
logging: Brandon Nakamura possible aptitudes: systems theory, creative
engineering. Marie Petrov emotional innovation, lateral cognition.  The
machine blinked its light-pattern output: 00100100.  “What does it mean?”
Marie asked.  Brandon smiled. “It means we’re just getting started.”  In
the park’s mesh chamber, gravity surrendered.  Marie launched herself off a
wall, spinning, laughing. Brandon curled into a ball and uncurled midair,
pretending to be a satellite.  “Do you think people in the old days ever
flew?” he asked, drifting past.  “Only in their dreams.”  CR-7N hovered
silently, monitoring vitals, calculating trajectories, softly humming a lullaby
from the 1990s.  They hacked their dream feeds. Saw the Psyche-Soma vines.
Laughed until their ears rang. Glitched the system and got away with it.  But
later that night, Brandon sat in his pod, staring at the stars on the ceiling.
“Seven?” he whispered.  “Yes, Brandon?”  “What happens if I fail? If
I don’t pick a path?”  CR-7N took three seconds longer than usual to
respond.  “Then you will continue. You will receive your UBI, your clarity,
your home. And someday, someone will say you lived comfortably.”  Brandon was
quiet.  “I want more than that,” he said.  “Then begin. Even I cannot
chart every constellation.”  At the holo-park, butterflies danced. Marie and
Brandon plotted their next rebellion.  Above them, the Global AI Council
debated probability fields. Below them, Coventry whispered through secret
networks.  Brandon reached into his pocket. A vent map. A folded note. A plan.
CR-7N watched, calculating.  Probability of sustained contentment: 99.1%.  But
something had changed.  Probability of divergence: Increasing.  Marie chased
Brandon across the grass. He laughed and tripped and caught her hand.
“Let’s build something real,” he said.  “Like what?”  He looked at
the sky.  “I don’t know yet. But I want to leave a mark. Like… a
signature. Or a new rule.”  And so, in a world designed to erase struggle,
two children played and began to write the future by refusing to accept the
present as enough.
