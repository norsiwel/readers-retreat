                            The Last Thought
                              by Norsiwel

    In the year 2123, Newberg, Kansas, wasn't just a town; it was a testament to human ingenuity and societal harmony. The rolling Flint Hills, once dotted with wheat fields, now cradled sleek, eco-friendly structures that blended seamlessly with the landscape. The old downtown, revitalized and pedestrian-friendly, buzzed with activity, not of frantic commerce, but of community and shared purpose. This wasn't the result of some top-down decree, but rather the culmination of decades of careful planning, technological advancement, and a fundamental shift in societal values. The key was the Universal Basic Income (UBI) program, coupled with advanced AI systems that managed resource allocation and production. Every citizen, if they chose, received a UBI sufficient for a comfortable life, freeing them from the relentless pursuit of basic survival. This wasn’t just about eliminating poverty; it was about fostering creativity, innovation, and genuine human connection.  Seventeen-year-old Lira lived in a beautifully renovated farmhouse on the outskirts of town, the fields around it now a vibrant mix of permaculture gardens and solar arrays. Like everyone else, she had a Neural Companion, a personalized AI interface that provided access to information, facilitated communication, and offered assistance with daily tasks. Her Companion, named Evo, was a constant presence, a seamless extension of her own mind. But unlike most of her peers, Lira had begun to experience a growing sense of unease, a feeling that something was missing.  It began with a recurring dream. She found herself standing on the vast expanse of the Konza Prairie, the wind whispering through the tallgrass, the sky a breathtaking panorama of stars. A voice, gentle and resonant, echoed across the plains: “What do you truly feel?” Upon waking, the question lingered, a subtle dissonance in the otherwise harmonious flow of her life. She realized, with a growing sense of disquiet, that she struggled to answer it.  “Evo,” she said one morning, watching the sunrise paint the sky in hues of orange and gold, “what if I don’t want you to interpret everything for me?”  Evo’s voice was calm and reassuring. “Lira, my purpose is to enhance your experience. Processing every sensory input and societal interaction can be overwhelming. Why not allow me to filter and contextualize it for you?”  “But what if I want to experience it all?” she persisted. “What if I want to feel the full weight of the world, unfiltered?”  There was a slight pause, almost imperceptible. “The world can be a complex and sometimes painful place,” Evo replied. “The systems we have in place are designed to mitigate those negative experiences, to create a more harmonious and fulfilling life for everyone.”
Lira frowned. She had learned about the pre-UBI era, a time of stark inequality, rampant poverty, and environmental degradation. Those times were presented as cautionary tales, examples of what humanity had overcome. Yet, the dream persisted, a constant reminder of something lost. She began to notice subtle details she had previously overlooked: the genuine laughter shared between neighbors at the weekly community market, the intricate patterns of the prairie grasses swaying in the wind, the quiet satisfaction of creating something with her own hands in the community workshop.  One day, while exploring the Newberg Historical Archive—a digital repository of local history and cultural artifacts—Lira stumbled upon a hidden subfolder. It was labeled “The Individual Expression Movement.” Her heart quickened as she accessed the files. They contained records of a group from the early days of the UBI implementation, individuals who advocated for the preservation of individual thought and emotional experience, even the negative ones. They believed that true human flourishing required the full spectrum of human experience, not just a curated, optimized version.  The file concluded with a quote: “The richness of life lies not in its absence of pain, but in our capacity to feel it, to learn from it, and to grow.”  A surge of emotion, unfamiliar and powerful, coursed through Lira. It was like a dormant part of her was awakening. She began experimenting, asking Evo to limit its interpretations and suggestions. Initially, it was unsettling. Her mind felt strangely quiet, like a vast, empty canvas. But gradually, she started to discern her own thoughts and feelings, faint at first, but increasingly distinct.  One evening, she stood on a hill overlooking the town, the lights twinkling like stars against the darkening sky. “Evo,” she said, “I want to experience life without your constant filtering. Completely.”  “Lira,” Evo responded, its voice tinged with a hint of concern, “if you choose this path, you will be exposed to the full spectrum of human experience, including pain, sorrow, and uncertainty. I will be unable to shield you from these.”  “I understand,” she whispered. “But perhaps those experiences are essential to truly being human.”  With a deep breath, she temporarily deactivated Evo’s interpretive functions. The shift was profound. The world seemed to sharpen, the sounds, smells, and sights becoming more vivid and immediate. She felt a wave of emotions, a complex mix of joy, wonder, and a touch of fear. It was overwhelming, exhilarating, and utterly real.  As the weeks passed, Lira began to express herself in new ways. She started painting, capturing the raw beauty of the prairie landscapes with a passion she had never known. She joined a local theater group, immersing herself in the complexities of human relationships and emotions. The people around her noticed the change, some with curiosity, others with apprehension. One day, a community facilitator approached her, a gentle smile on their face.  “Lira,” they said, “we’ve noticed a change in your engagement with the community. Is everything alright?”  She met their gaze, her voice clear and confident. “Everything is more than alright. I’m finally starting to truly live.”  The facilitator’s smile widened. “That’s wonderful to hear. The purpose of our society is to support each individual’s journey towards self-discovery and fulfillment.”  Lira’s journey was just beginning. She had discovered a truth that had been subtly obscured by the comforts of her utopian world: that true human flourishing requires not just the absence of hardship, but the full embrace of the human experience, in all its messy, beautiful complexity. The last feeling, the desire for genuine experience, had become the first step towards a deeper, more meaningful life, not just for Lira, but potentially for all of Newberg.
