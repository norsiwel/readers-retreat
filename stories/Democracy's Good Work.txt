Democracy's Good Work  
by Norsiwel

The room smelled like bleach and bad wiring. Jack Harper sat on the edge of the steel tub, rolling up the sleeves of his government-issue gray sweats. The tank loomed in front of him; a hulking, coffin-shaped thing, all rivets and peeling olive paint. They called it "the aquarium" down in STARGATE's basement wing. A joke, maybe. Nobody laughed.

"You want the mask today, Harper?" The tech, a kid with a wispy mustache and a clipboard, stood by the door. His nametag read Carlson. Fresh out of Langley's junior spy nursery, probably.

Jack lit a cigarette, ignoring the NO SMOKING sign bolted to the cinderblock wall. "You ever seen what happens when they pump nitrogen into a sealed space, Carlson?"

"Uh. No, sir."

"Me neither. Let's keep it that way." He crushed the cigarette under his heel, climbed into the tank. The water was lukewarm, slick with Epsom salts. It swallowed him like a lukewarm grave.

The lid hissed shut.

Darkness.

Then the hum; the sound of a thousand bees trapped in his skull. Remote viewing protocol: Focus on the coordinates. Moscow. Lubyanka Square. November 12, 1985. The defector's meetup. Standard pre-mission recon.

But the signal slipped.

Static crackled behind his eyes. The smell hit him first; Stolichnaya and stale sweat. Then the cold. His boots crunched snow that wasn't there. Lubyanka's yellow facade loomed, pockmarked with bullet scars from '41. A black Volga idled at the curb, exhaust curling like a skeleton's finger.

Wrong. This isn't the street.

The scene blinked.

Now he was sitting. Chair legs screeched against concrete. His wrists burned; rope, tight enough to draw blood. A single bulb swung overhead, throwing shadows on a face: a KGB goon with a scar like a sickle moon curling from lip to eyebrow. The man leaned in, breath reeking of cabbage and regret.

"Gde ona?" Where is she?

Jack's tongue felt thick. "Who?"

The slap came hard, Russian-hard. The taste of copper bloomed. The goon slid a photo across the table. A schoolgirl in a blue dress, standing in front of a Maryland diner. Emily. Age 9. His daughter.

"You think CIA protects you?" The Russian's accent was grease and gravel. "We know your blood. We know your fears."

A Makarov appeared in his hand. Jack's heart jackhammered; this wasn't protocol, this wasn't the mission;

BANG.

He gasped, water sloshing as he slammed upright in the tank. The lid was already open. Carlson stood back, eyes wide. "Jesus, Harper. You were out cold. Like…dead cold."

Jack clawed at the edge of the tub, saltwater dripping off his jaw. His hands shook. Real hands. Alive hands.

"Get me a phone," he rasped.

"Sir, the debrief;"

"Now, Carlson."

The kid scrambled. Jack stared at the puddle forming on the floor. The photo of Emily flickered in his mind. The KGB shouldn't know about her. Couldn't know. He'd buried that life six years ago, same day his ex-wife changed the locks.

The future, they said, wasn't set in stone.

But Jack Harper had just seen his own headstone.

The diner coffee tasted like motor oil. Jack stirred in a third sugar, watching the granules dissolve into the black. Across the booth, Doc Rosten; a shriveled ex-Army psychiatrist turned STARGATE consultant; nursed a bourbon neat at 10 a.m. His tweed jacket smelled like mothballs and regret.

"You ever heard of projective episodic synthesis?" Rosten rasped, swirling his glass.

"Sounds like a commie band."

"It's when stress fabricates false memories. Brain stitches together fears, old intel, bad liverwurst." He jabbed a finger at Jack's untouched eggs. "You're what, forty-two? Arteries clogging, eyes going. Perfect recipe for a phantom."

Jack flicked a dossier across the table. Inside: surveillance stills of a KGB colonel, face blurred. "Scarred guy. Left cheek. Ring any bells?"

Rosten squinted. "Could be half the Kremlin. Why?"

"Saw him in the tank. He knew things."

"Things you know. Subconscious regurgitation. Basic Freud."

"He knew about Emily."

Rosten's glass paused mid-sip. "Ah."

Back at Langley, Jack raided the Archives. The basement reeked of mildew and institutional denial. File cabinets groaned; Soviet military dossiers piled up. Volkov. Ivan. KGB Counterintelligence. Born '43, Minsk. Jack's fingers froze on a '79 debrief transcript:

INTERROGATOR: Describe Volkov's distinguishing features.  
DEFECTOR: Sickle-shaped scar. Left cheek. From a Polish dissident's knife, I heard.

The photo paper trembled in Jack's grip. The defector had been shot dead in '81.

"Coincidence."

Mara leaned against the briefing room door, arms crossed. Her blouse was starch-stiff, hair pinned like a general's. "You're connecting dots that aren't there, Harper. Volkov's a desk jockey now. No field ops since '83."

Jack tossed the scarred-face still on the table. "Then why's he in my head?"

"Because you're running on nicotine and three hours of sleep. Because you're flying to Moscow tomorrow and your ex won't let you call your kid." She softened. "Go home. Shower. Eat something that isn't from a vending machine."

"They're gonna grab me, Mara. I saw it."

"You saw fear. That's all the tank ever shows."

The door opened. Section Chief Rigby strode in, a walking brick wall in a Brooks Brothers suit. He didn't sit. "Harper. You're off the psych eval roster. Wheels up at 0700."

"Sir, the mission's compromised;"

"Compromised is what happens when a psychic starts believing his own bullshit." Rigby's cufflink glinted, a tiny American eagle. "Do the job. Meet the defector. Or I'll find someone who can."

The door slammed.

Mara handed Jack a matchbook. Inside, a Moscow phone number inked in red. "Burner safehouse. Just in case."

"You believe me?"

"I believe Rigby's an asshole." She smirked, but her eyes stayed grave. "Don't die proving me right."

Jack sat at his kitchen table, writing his weekly letter to his daughter Emily. Feeling alone and isolated, talking to his daughter even by mail eased his mind a bit. He finished up with, "and be sure to do what your Mother tells you. I know she loves you and so do I, and no matter what you hear or read about me don't believe it, just keep checking your mail." He sealed the envelope and went to the front door to put it in the mailbox, then shuffled off to a hot shower and the rest he so needed.

Reagan National Airport smelled like floor wax and burnt coffee. Jack flashed his passport at the check-in counter; David Kern, Import/Export Consultant; and watched the gate agent's eyes glaze over. The barcode did its magic. No questions, no sweat. Democracy's good work, smooth as a Swiss watch.

Twelve hours later, Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport hit him like a vodka-soaked fist. The border inspector; a slab-faced woman with a perm tight enough to crack walnuts; flipped through his phony passport. Jack braced for theatrics: Why no Cyrillic stamps? What's in the briefcase? But she just yawned, smacked her gum, and stamped the page. Thud.

Too easy.

Outside, the cold bit through his trench coat. A Lada taxi idled at the curb, exhaust coughing into the slate-gray dawn. The driver hunched under a floppy wool hat, face hidden.

"Gostinitsa?" the man barked, voice like gravel in a tin can. "Hotel? Girls? Ochen' deshyovo."

Jack tossed his briefcase onto the cracked backseat. "Just drive."

The Lada lurched into traffic. Jack cracked the window, let the Moscow air sharpen his nerves; diesel fumes, frozen earth, the sour tang of a regime that never slept. His reflection flickered in the rearview: clean-shaven, rested, almost convincing. He noted with interest the driver's immaculate kid driving gloves and wondered how a Lada taxi driver could afford those. Then he thought that Mara's advice had been solid. Shower. Shave. Pretend you're human.

Then the driver turned to haggle with a babushka selling pirozhki at a stoplight.

The scar glared at him. Sickle-shaped. Left cheek.

Volkov.

Jack's gut tightened. The vision unspooled again; rope burns, the Makarov's muzzle, Emily's photo. He palmed the matchbook Mara had given him, edges digging into his flesh.

"You like computer parts, tovarisch?" The driver caught his eye in the mirror, grinning. Gold tooth. "Big market now. Silicon, da?"

"Just drive."

"Is good business, America and Russia. No politics. Only profit." Volkov; had to be him; tapped the steering wheel with a gloved finger. "But sometimes… profit needs friends."

Jack's hand crept toward his ankle holster. "What's that mean?"

The Lada swerved down a side alley, tires skidding on black ice. Volkov yanked the hat lower. "Means I know what you are. What you fear."

The matchbook burned in Jack's fist. Burner safehouse. Just in case.

He leaned forward, pressed the ceramic .22 to the back of the driver's seat. "Pull over. Now."

Volkov laughed, a dry, rattling sound. "You shoot, whole militia comes. Boom. Mission dead." He tossed a Polaroid onto the seat. Emily, bundled in a winter coat, walking into her Maryland school. Yesterday's date stamped in the corner.

"I turn left at next street," Volkov said. "We talk business. Or daughter learns daddy's real job."

Jack tossed the ceramic revolver onto the passenger seat. Volkov picked it up. "Interesting toy. Shooting me with it would've made me angry."

"What do you want?" Jack's voice was low and even, showing weakness now was not an option.

"Zubov, of course," Volkov was relaxed. "He knows far too many of our secrets to go home, ever."

Volkov's English was near perfect and it had become perfectly clear to Jack that he had been set up, sacrificed so that the deep double could escape. He was expendable. Suddenly CIA retirement became very clear. He received his instructions without further comment and Volkov dropped him at the hotel. None of his choices was clear, but his memory of the tank was. His one advantage was knowing.

The Lada accelerated away. Jack turned and walked into the Hilton. The future wasn't a river.

It was a trapdoor.

The Hilton's lobby was all marble and muted chandeliers, but the room they gave Jack smelled like wet carpet and regret. He tossed his briefcase on the bed, cranked the radiator to full blast, and tore the place apart. He found the bugs inside fifteen minutes; two in the phone, one behind the painting of Lenin smirking over a wheat field. Classic KGB hospitality.

Volkov's Polaroid of Emily stared up from the nightstand. Yesterday's date. Jack lit a cigarette, watched the smoke curl toward the ceiling vent. They wanted him rattled. They wanted him to trust the defector; Anatoly Zubov, a "disillusioned" missile engineer; without asking why a man who'd spent a decade in Siberia's black sites would suddenly crave Iowa cornfields and ABC sitcoms.

Because he's a double. Because this whole dance is a funnel.

The phone rang.

Jack let it scream. On the fifth ring, he picked up.

"Welcome to Moscow, Mr. Kern," Volkov purred. "Sleep well. Tomorrow, you shake hands with your new best friend."

"Go chew a transformer."

"Tsk. Rude." The line crackled, a predator's exhale. "Remember, Harper; fail me, and your daughter's teacher gets… curious photos of you. With very bad men."

Click.

Jack dialed the matchbook number. Three rings, then a garbled voice: "Pecherskaya Bathhouse."

"It's Kern. I need a broom."

Static. Then Mara's voice, thin but clear under the scrambler's warble: "Broom?"

"To sweep up the rats."

A pause. Keys clattered. "There's a laundromat on Tverskaya. Drop-off at 22:00. Ask for Yulia."

"She clean?"

"Spotless. GRU turned her in '78. She's been folding Party underwear ever since."

Jack eyed the bugs, the painting. Let them hear. Let them think he was playing along. "Tell her I like starch."

"Don't die before the spin cycle."

Mara hung up the phone, hoping that the arrangements she had made would work out. Being unable to use company assets because the higher-ups did not lend any credence to Jack's visions, she had to draw on old connections from when she had been a field agent; the Russian underground, not well funded and not well equipped, but capable of some amazing things when given the chance.

Midnight. The laundromat reeked of bleach and dirty laundry. Yulia was a squat woman with a steel-gray perm and hands like vise grips. She took his wrinkled shirt without looking up.

"Back room," she muttered in Ukrainian-tinted Russian. "Hurry."

The "back room" was a mop closet. Taped behind a bucket was a Tokarev pistol and a slip of paper: SAFEHOUSE 9 - KROPOTKINSKAYA 12. Jack pocketed both. Yulia's voice cut through the door: "Leave the way you came. And burn the shirt."

He did.

The meet was set for noon at Gorky Park. Jack arrived early, scoped the benches. A frozen pond glittered; kids skated figure-eights under militia watch. Zubov arrived late, face pinched under a ushanka, eyes darting like sparrows. He clutched a Pravda newspaper; correct fold, correct page. All the right moves.

"You… Kern?" Zubov's breath fogged the air.

Jack nodded. "Where's the package?"

"Not here. Too many eyes. Tonight. Bolshoy Theatre. Coat check."

"Why the switch?"

Zubov leaned in, reeking of fear and cheap gin. "Because your people have a leak. Because they know you're here."

Jack almost laughed. The script was perfect; paranoia as perfume. "And you're the good Samaritan?"

"I'm a dead man." Zubov's hand trembled as he lit a cigarette. "Like you."

A whistle shrilled. Two militsiya officers strolled past, batons tapping palms. Zubov flinched, dropped his cigarette. When he bent to grab it, Jack glimpsed the pistol under his coat; a sleek Walther PPK, standard CIA issue.

There's your leak.

Jack stood. "Bolshoy. Tonight."

"Da. Democracy's good work."

Zubov scurried off. Across the pond, a man in a floppy hat watched from a bench. Volkov. He tipped his brim, a sickle-shaped smile.

The Hilton's hot tub was a concrete coffin filled with piss-warm water. Jack dry-swallowed two of the chalky blue pills he'd lifted from Rosten's desk; Valium, 10mg, "for psychic overclocking"; and sank until his ears submerged. The radiator hissed. The bugs listened. Let them.

He closed his eyes.

The pills hit like a velvet hammer.

Darkness gave way to flickers; a cramped Moscow apartment, peeling floral wallpaper, the tinny cough of a radiator. A girl lay on a sagging sofa, maybe twelve, her hair gone patchy from chemo. An oxygen tank wheezed beside her. Anya Volkov. Diagnosis: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Prognosis: Poor.

Ivan Volkov stood in the kitchenette, sleeves rolled up, scrubbing a blood-specked handkerchief in the sink. His scar pulsed red under the bare bulb. A framed photo on the fridge showed Anya healthy, grinning in a Pioneer scarf. Now she whimpered in her sleep. Volkov froze, gripping the sink until his knuckles cracked.

Jack jolted upright, water sloshing over the tub's edge. His heart thrashed. The Valium buzz had curdled into something sharp, metallic. Anya. The chemo. The handkerchief. Volkov wasn't just a goon; he was a cornered animal.

Jack toweled off, hands steady now. The Tokarev from Yulia's stash felt cold against his ribs as he buttoned his shirt. He flipped the room's phone off the hook; let the bugs hear dead air; and strapped a garrote wire around his calf.

The ballet started in two hours.

At the mirror, he knotted his tie. Emily's face flickered in his reflection. You're not the only one with a daughter, Ivan.

He palmed Mara's matchbook, memorized the safehouse address one last time, then struck a match. Let it burn to his fingertips before dropping it into the sink.

Showtime.

The Bolshoy Theatre's chandeliers dripped light like frozen stars. Volkov lingered in the shadows of the mezzanine, a cigarette smoldering between his fingers. Below, jacketed elites sipped champagne, oblivious to the rot festering in their marble hive. His earpiece crackled.

"Zubov's in position," a voice hissed. "American's entering the east lobby."

Volkov's thumb grazed the sickle-shaped scar. Semipalatinsk, he thought. The memory was a shard of glass: winds howling across the Kazakh steppe, his boots crunching irradiated snow. They'd told him the test site was "safe." Told him to bring Anya to the family barracks. For the Motherland, they'd said.

Now her hair fell out in clumps.

Jack spotted Zubov at the coat check, fiddling with his fake mustache. The supposed defector clutched a leather satchel; too flat for missile schematics. Bait. Always bait.

"Kern!" Zubov waved, too loud. "Your coat, yes?"

Jack didn't blink. "Let's skip the matinee. Where's the package?"

Zubov's grin faltered. "Is… inside. Special compartment;"

Jack grabbed his wrist, twisted. The satchel thudded open. Empty.

"You're a shitty actor," Jack snarled.

The chandeliers dimmed. Volkov flicked his cigarette. The signal.

Ballet patrons screamed as militia swarmed the aisles. Jack bolted, vaulting velvet ropes, Zubov's pleas drowned by Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake still screeching from the speakers. East exit; sealed. West stairwell; locked. A stagehand's door yawned ahead.

Too easy.

He burst into a narrow corridor. Empty. Silent.

The tranq dart punched his neck before he heard the hiss.

Cold.

Rope.

Flickering bulb.

Jack's vision swam into focus. The room matched his vision; down to the water stains on the concrete. Volkov loomed over him, rolling up his sleeves. No Makarov. Just a syringe of clear liquid.

"Welcome to real diplomacy," Volkov said.

Jack's tongue felt like lead. "Your daughter… Anya. Semipalatinsk."

Volkov froze.

"Leukemia. From the tests." Jack leaned into the ropes, blood warming his wrists. "CIA's got a drug. Trial phase. Stops the… the cell burn."

Was it a lie, Jack wondered as he said it. But Volkov's eyes flickered; a crack in the ice.

"You think I'm a fool?" Volkov hissed.

"I think you're a father."

The syringe trembled. Somewhere, a distant phone rang.

Volkov turned.

Click.

Jack's tiny ceramic blade; hidden in his cuff; sliced through the rope.

Volkov's thumb grazed his scar, the memory of Anya's laughter in Semipalatinsk echoing as Jack spat, "Your daughter's death is not what has to happen." The syringe trembled. For a heartbeat, the room held its breath; then the phone on the desk rang. Volkov turned.

Jack's hands hissed free, the rope falling away from his wrists. He lunged, not at the door, but at the flickering bulb. Darkness swallowed the room. Somewhere, a child's voice whispered, "Papa?"; real or imagined, it froze Volkov long enough for Jack to vanish.

The rooftop wind screamed like a gutshot bear. Jack's ribs throbbed with every step, the remaining rope still dangling from his wrist. Below, alarms wailed. Above, the Moscow sky hung low and dark, the snowflakes needling his eyes.

Go up. Yulia's last words over last call he'd received before he left the hotel, his laundry was ready, echoed. The old bird flies at 0200. Catch the claw or eat your gun.

He'd laughed then. Wasn't laughing now.

Volkov's voice boomed from the stairwell. "Stop him!"

Jack slammed the roof door, wedged it with a fire axe. The 1930s AN-2 biplane materialized through the blizzard; a hulking, ancient workhorse, its single radial engine droning through the night. The Russian underground pilot looked death in the eye just flying on a night like this. A steel cable trailed behind it, strung with a makeshift harness: two carabiners and a prayer.

Closer. Closer.

The plane banked, cable whipping sideways. Jack sprinted, boots skidding on ice. He leaped, fingers grazing frozen metal;

Missed.

He hit the roof hard. The AN-2 circled back.

"Harper!" Volkov burst onto the roof, Makarov raised. His scar glowed red under the Kremlin's distant glare. "It's over!"

Jack spat blood. "Your daughter's dead in six months without the serum."

Volkov's trigger finger twitched.

The plane roared overhead. Jack lunged. The cable hooked him mid-air.

The jolt ripped his shoulder raw. Moscow spun below; Lubyanka's yellow teeth, the Moskva River's frozen snarl; as the AN-2 clawed altitude. Volkov's shots pinged off the fuselage. Then snow swallowed the city.

In the hold, Yulia manned the winch, her steel perm askew. "Welcome to retirement, Amerikanski."

Jack collapsed onto a crate of Moldovan cognac. "Georgia. No stops."

"Da." She tossed him a flask. "Then Turkey. Then… konyets."

The flask burned going down. Jack flicked Volkov's Polaroid of Emily into the propeller wash. Let it rot in the dark.

Epilogue:

Two weeks later. The CIA burned David Kern's file. Jack Harper's grave got fresh flowers.

On a Maryland porch, Emily opened a postmarked envelope; no note, just a faded ballet ticket. Swan Lake. Bolshoy Theatre. November 12, 1985. She tacked it to her wall, next to a postcard: Greetings from Tbilisi!

Jack smiled a bitter smile as he posted the airmail envelope with the new cancer drug vial in it, and hoped that he had gotten the current address for Volkov. He spun on his heel and walked off into the placid night and retirement.

Somewhere in the Caucasus, Volkov received an unmarked vial. He injected it into Anya's IV bag in her hospital room, hoping for a future to choose its shape. The drug was not a lie. She awoke with the spring that would free millions from the cold.
