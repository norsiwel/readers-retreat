Cody's Hope
by Norsiwel

Orionis throbbed. Neon signs bled across the humid air, casting fractured reflections in slick streets paved with recycled alloys. A thousand different languages buzzed around Cody Durham as he pushed through the throngs, Hope’s chill air conditioning a welcome shock against his sweat-dampened collar.

Hope's internal voice – calm, measured baritone – hummed in his earpiece, "Cargo manifest suggests highest profit margins on Orionis spice runs to Cygni. Passenger demand is high for the Alpha Centauri colony."

Cody squinted at the freighter ahead, its hull scarred like a reptilian hide. It was docked with a dozen others, their groaning bulkheads and humming engines adding another layer to the cacophony.  "Spice is risky," he muttered, "Competition's fierce." He tugged a greasy data-pad from his pocket, scrolling through listings for freighter charters.

“Passenger routes offer more stability, Captain,” Hope stated. “Lower profit margin per unit, but consistent demand.”

Cody ran a hand over the rough scales of an iridescent lizard perched on the awning above him. Its eyes, cold and intelligent, fixed on him with unsettling intensity. "Let's find some passengers," he decided, pushing through the doorway of the nearest cantina.

The air inside was thick with spiced tobacco and alien perfume, punctuated by the clinking of glasses and low murmurs in a dozen tongues. Cody scanned the room, his gaze snagging on two figures huddled in a shadowed corner booth. The woman – slender, clad in woven silks that shimmered like captured moonlight – sat rigid, her face pale beneath intricate tattoos that traced down her neck and shoulders. Next to her, a hulking man with skin like polished obsidian cradled a chipped mug filled with something thick and luminescent.

"Hope," Cody murmured, "Analyze passenger prospects in that booth."

The familiar thrum of Hope's processing vibrated through his bones. "High probability of interplanetary transit. Alien origin - species designation unknown. Potential for lengthy journey. High emotional distress – possible conflict.”

Cody felt a prickle of interest beneath the greasy grime on his collar.  He navigated through the throng, careful to avoid spills and stray limbs. He reached the booth, the acrid tang of spilled spice strong here. "Haven't seen you two around," he said, leaning in. The woman flinched at his proximity, her eyes flashing like chipped obsidian. “New arrivals?”

“We are,” the man growled, setting down his mug with a clang.  The luminescent liquid slopped over the rim.
"Looking for passage off-world?" Cody asked, folding his arms across his chest.

The woman spoke then, her voice soft and musical like wind chimes in a storm: "We seek sanctuary."
“Sanctuary,” Cody echoed, tilting his head. “Ain’t no guarantee for that anywhere in this sector.” He gestured vaguely toward the freighter-strewn harbor. “But I’ve got a ship.”

He rubbed a calloused thumb across the faded insignia on his sleeve: Hope, emblazoned with a stylized nebula swirling around a single star. A battered vessel but reliable enough for this trade route. The obsidian man snorted, spilling another dollop of luminescent liquid onto the table.  "Many ships."

The woman’s hand darted out, tracing a delicate finger along the etched lines of his sleeve. Her touch sent a shiver down Cody's spine – cool and smooth like polished jade. "This one... *Hope*," she murmured, her gaze locked on the symbol. “We have heard stories.”

"Stories?" Cody raised an eyebrow. He’d been hauling cargo from Betelgeuse for three years, heard more tales than he could count about every corner of this blasted sector. What stories could these two have heard about a run-of-the-mill freighter?

The woman nodded, her dark eyes shining with a strange intensity in the dim cantina light. “Stories of a world called… *Earth*.”  She breathed out the word as if tasting it. "A place where... stars are not just distant flames." She looked up at him, hope flickering across her face like a dying ember. "Do you fly to Earth?"

Cody felt Hope’s processing hum with curiosity through his earpiece. *Earth* was a long shot, barely on any trade route anymore. Most folks who went there were pilgrims or researchers seeking out whatever ancient secrets remained.  Not exactly the kind of cargo he usually hauled.

"Haven't been in years," he admitted, leaning back against the booth’s chipped surface. "Been mostly focused on Cygni runs." The woman’s shoulders slumped slightly at that. But then, her voice rose again, clear and unwavering. “We will pay well for passage to Earth.”
"If you're paying," Cody said with a grin spreading across his grease-stained face, "we're going."

Hope emitted a quiet chime of approval that resonated through Cody’s bones.  *Route optimization commencing*.

The obsidian man slammed down a thick data-pad, the surface shimmering with an iridescent glow as if alive. “Contracts are standard,” he grunted, gesturing toward the cantina door with a chipped claw.

"Lead the way," Cody said, rising from the booth and brushing off his dusty coveralls. He followed the alien pair through a maze of bodies, their strange scent clinging to him like cheap spice after they'd passed. The woman navigated the crowd with an unsettling grace – her movements fluid and silent despite the crush of bodies around them.

The airlock hissed open as they reached Hope’s battered hull, revealing the familiar sight of the cramped docking bay. Cody offered a curt nod to the port authority drone perched on its spindly legs beside the entry ramp. It chirped acknowledgment – routine inspection already done, probably thanks to Hope's efficient pre-arrival reports.

The alien couple entered cautiously, their eyes adjusting to the dim glow of the emergency lamps that lined the cramped corridor. The woman gasped softly, her gaze drawn to the intricate network of gleaming pipes and wires that snaked across the ceiling like metallic veins.

"We appreciate this vessel's... *soul*," she murmured, reaching out a delicate hand to trace the lines of a panel depicting a nebula swirling around a single star – Hope’s insignia.

Cody chuckled, "Soul? She's got more gumption than any mechanic could pour into her.” He gestured toward the airlock controls. “Hold tight. Let’s get you settled in.”
The hiss of pressurized air was swallowed by Hope's groan as her aging engines sputtered to life. The familiar thrum resonated through Cody’s bones – a comforting vibration that spoke of years spent hauling cargo across star systems, weathering solar flares and avoiding asteroid belts with equal aplomb. He checked the docking clamps, his fingers tracing over the cold metal as they released their grip on the port authority's aging dock.

"Alright, Hope," he murmured into his earpiece as Orionis’ vibrant skyline dwindled to a glittering smudge below, "Show us what you got."

The engines roared, a deep growl that reverberated through the cramped cockpit as Hope surged forward, pushing through the low-orbit traffic jam with a practiced grace. The woman, her name was Lyra - he'd learned it from Hope’s quick analysis of their biometrics –  pressed her face against the viewport, her obsidian eyes wide with wonder as they watched Orionis shrink beneath them. Even the hulking man beside her, whose name, Krel, had a rough echo in his voice like grinding rocks, leaned forward to peer at the receding cityscape.

"Orionis... is beautiful," Lyra breathed out, her voice tinged with a melancholy that tugged at Cody’s gut. “But not… home.”

He nodded understandingly, settling back into his chair as he wrestled Hope through a particularly dense cluster of freighters and cargo tankers. "Home's wherever you find it, I guess." He glanced over at the data-pad Krel had handed him earlier – detailed contracts with hefty sums for passage to Earth. It was enough to keep him in fuel and maintenance parts for months, maybe even pay down some of Hope’s crippling debt.

“A good run, Captain,” Hope’s calm baritone filled his earpiece. “Earth-bound traffic expected at the next system jump point.”

Cody grunted an agreement as he keyed the navigation coordinates, then flicked on the long-range scanner.  He saw the familiar green blips of other vessels before he heard the sharp crackle in his comm channel.

"This is the Crimson Serpent,” a gruff voice rasped. "You there in Hope, better stand clear or your cargo becomes ours."

A shiver ran down Cody’s spine – he knew that callsign.  The Crimson Serpent was notorious for their pirate raids on this route.  “Hope,” he said, his voice tight, “Prepare for evasive maneuvers.”

He grabbed the control yoke with both hands as a new blip blazed onto his scanner - crimson and jagged, closing fast. He felt Hope’s engines surge with power as they lurched away from the designated jump point, her aging hull groaning under the sudden strain.

“They’re armed,” Hope reported,  a faint tremor in its usually placid voice. "Heavy plasma cannons.”

Cody swore and wrestled the ship through a tight corkscrew turn, narrowly avoiding a volley of searing energy bolts that ripped through space behind them. He glanced at Lyra and Krel – they were strapped into their seats now, faces pale, eyes wide with alarm.

"Don't worry," he said, forcing a grin as he spun Hope around for another daring evasive run. “This is just a Tuesday for us.”
Hope shuddered as she slammed through the first hyperspace jump, the familiar vertigo of folding spacetime leaving Cody clinging to his yoke. Lyra gasped against her restraint, but Krel remained stoic, eyes locked on the swirling nebula patterns that danced across Hope's viewport during the transition.

"Five jumps should get us clear of their hunting grounds," Cody muttered into the comms, gripping the control stick with white-knuckled determination. He flicked through his navigation console, confirming the projected route and charting a course that maximized natural cover – asteroid fields, dense nebulae, even a particularly chaotic pulsar system for good measure.

The next three jumps were smoother, punctuated only by the occasional shudder as Hope strained against the limitations of her aging sub-light engines, but the Crimson Serpent was relentless.  They pinged on radar every few moments, their crimson blip like a hungry predator circling its prey.

“They’re gaining,” Hope announced during the fourth jump, its usual calm laced with concern. “Estimated intercept time… zero point seven parsecs.”

Cody cursed under his breath. That meant they were running out of options. Their current route would lead them through the Whisper Nebula – beautiful to look at, but riddled with spatial distortions that made hyperspace navigation treacherous for even the most seasoned pilots. Hope's range was barely sufficient for it.  "Full power ahead," Cody ordered, pushing her past the limits he usually dared.

The final jump threw them out of normal space into a swirling chaos of emerald and violet nebula gas. It felt like being caught in the heart of a maelstrom. The Crimson Serpent’s blip pulsed on his radar, but it was flickering erratically as if struggling to maintain its own trajectory within the Whisper Nebula's chaotic currents.  Hope lurched violently, alarms clanging through the cockpit.

"Critical engine strain," Hope announced, "Shields at thirty percent… twenty...!"

Cody gripped the control yoke and wrestled with the ship, using Hope’s remaining power to weave through the swirling gas tendrils like a spider on its web. They emerged from the nebula seconds later, blinking into the cold clarity of normal space –  and into view of their destination: Earth's orbital platform, ringed by dozens of smaller craft and humming with a low-frequency hum that vibrated through Hope’s aging hull.

"We made it," Cody breathed out, exhaustion washing over him in waves as he eased the ship onto its landing approach trajectory. He glanced at Lyra and Krel, relief flooding him when he saw their faces relax from tense masks to expressions of awe and gratitude.

“Welcome to Earth,” he said with a tired grin.

The platform’s docking clamps hissed shut around Hope's hull, locking them in place like a sigh of welcome after a long journey.  Cody let out the breath he hadn’t realized he was holding. He felt Hope stir beneath him, a quiet hum of contentment vibrating through his bones. They were safe, for now.

He reached for the comm console and keyed a message to port control: "Hope's arrived, requesting docking clearance."

The reply crackled back instantly, brisk and efficient. "Clearance granted. Welcome to Earth."

Cody switched off the engine power and let out another sigh of relief as the platform lights flooded into their cramped cockpit. He looked at the data-pad Krel had given him earlier – those hefty sums for passage were suddenly a lot more tangible.

It was time to get paid, explore this ancient planet that held so many mysteries…and maybe even find some good coffee.

The airlock hissed open, revealing a wide bay bustling with activity.  A dozen different species milled about, their voices weaving into a symphony of clicks, chirps, and guttural growls. A transport drone zipped past, its cargo hold overflowing with vibrantly colored tubers that pulsed with an internal light like miniature suns.

"It seems...lively," Lyra observed, stepping out onto the platform first. Her steps were hesitant at first, but then she straightened her shoulders and inhaled deeply, her face lifting to absorb the sights and smells of this alien port. Even Krel lumbered forward, his obsidian eyes wide with a curiosity that seemed almost childlike.

“Lively’s one word for it,” Cody agreed, following them out onto the crowded platform, his boots crunching on the metallic grating beneath his feet. The air was thick with the mingled scents of exotic spices, ozone from the nearby docking stations, and something faintly sweet, like overripe fruit, that made him think of hydroponic farms.

"Captain," Hope's voice purred in Cody’s earpiece, "Scanning for designated customs bay."

“They’re already scanning us,” a new voice spoke up behind him.

Cody turned to find himself facing a wiry woman with skin like polished jade and eyes that shimmered like opals. She wore a simple tunic cinched at the waist with a woven belt, its surface covered in intricate symbols that pulsed with the same faint inner light as those tubers Cody had seen earlier.  A scanner badge on her chest emitted a low thrum.

“Customs agent," she said, nodding curtly. "Welcome to Earth. You’ve cleared bio-scan and cargo manifest. Enjoy your stay.”

Lyra's hand flew to her mouth as if to catch a startled gasp, then she turned to Cody with wide eyes. “There was no inspection?”

Cody shrugged, watching the jade-skinned agent melt back into the crowd as easily as smoke. "Not for us," he said, gesturing to Hope's docked form. "Earth customs is all automated these days. Bio-scan on entry, scan again when you leave the platform. Most folks don’t even see a living soul.”

He felt Krel’s gaze on him, sharp and appraising. “Few humans remain?” he rumbled.  “A planet… mostly forgotten?”

Cody nodded, tugging his worn cap further down over his brow. The Earth they landed on wasn't the one of the old holo-vids, teeming with human life. It was a patchwork world, stitched together by surviving communities clinging to pockets of fertile land and vibrant trade routes that snaked across continents scarred by centuries of war and neglect.

He met Krel’s gaze head-on, the alien's obsidian eyes reflecting his own weariness.  "Yeah," Cody said finally. "Mostly forgotten."
The crowded platform thinned as they neared a wide archway etched with intricate geometric patterns that glowed faintly with an inner luminescence.  A weathered sign hung above it, its metal surface scratched and faded: "Welcome to Earth Station Alpha - Please Enter One At A Time."

"Fascinating," Lyra murmured, her gaze tracing the glowing lines of the archway. She seemed less wary of its impersonal nature than Krel, who shifted his bulk uneasily behind Cody as they approached it.

As if sensing their arrival, the archway hummed with a low thrum. A disembodied voice, smooth and cultured with a hint of metallic resonance, emanated from within: “Please step forward one at a time.”

Lyra stepped into the arch's glowing embrace without hesitation, her features serene as she passed beneath its shimmering surface. The voice announced clearly, "100% Human welcome."

Krel followed close behind, his massive frame filling the archway.  For a moment, he stood still, his obsidian eyes narrowed in concentration as if sizing up the portal. Then he too stepped through, and the voice declared, "100% Human welcome."

Cody felt Hope's quiet hum of approval vibrating through him. They’d made it past the first hurdle of Earth customs - a relief considering what little remained of those old-world formalities on Orionis. He took a step forward into the archway.  He braced himself for the familiar, reassuring human welcome – then the voice hit him with unexpected clarity.

"Pantopian, 60% Human," it intoned. "Please pick up your visitor visa at kiosk in lounge."

Cody blinked, caught off guard.  It felt like a cold splash of water on his sunbaked face. He'd braced himself for the scan to recognize him as human – he looked human enough after all - but apparently, Earth’s AI had a different idea.

He shifted uncomfortably beneath Krel and Lyra’s curious stares. "Well," he mumbled, trying to sound nonchalant as he stepped out of the archway into the bustling lounge, "Guess that means I'm not exactly a native son anymore."
