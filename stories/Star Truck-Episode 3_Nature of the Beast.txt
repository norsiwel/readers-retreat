Star Truck-Episode 3 : Nature of the Beast
Act 1
Chapter 1: Hidden Agendas

The dim glow of the command seat’s interface illuminated Cody Duncan’s face
as he scrolled through the datapad Lyra Vance had handed him. The words on the
screen were crisp and clinical, detailing everything from planetary geography
to cultural nuances—too many details for a simple trade mission, yet
frustratingly vague where it mattered most. Something about the document
felt... off. It wasn’t just the suddenness of the CSS’s interest in him or
the polished veneer of professionalism Lyra exuded; it was deeper than that.
Like staring at a starship blueprint missing key components, there was an
emptiness beneath the surface—a void waiting to be uncovered.  “ME,” Cody
said aloud, his voice cutting through the quiet hum of the *Hope*’s systems.
“Run a full analysis on this datapad. Cross-reference every detail with known
galactic databases, including any anomalies you can find.”  A soft chime
signaled ME’s acknowledgment. “Processing now, Captain,” came the smooth,
synthetic voice—the harmonized tones of Marcus and Echo seamlessly blending
into one unified presence. “Initial scans indicate several inconsistencies
within the metadata structure. Shall I prioritize decryption protocols?”
Cody leaned back in his chair, rubbing his temples. If anyone could spot a
needle in a haystack, it was ME. “Do it. And flag anything unusual. I want to
know if this so-called ‘first contact’ scenario is what it claims to
be—or something else entirely.”  As ME worked, Cody replayed the encounter
with Lyra in his mind. Her poise, her precision—it all screamed competence,
but also caution. He’d seen enough corporate double-talk to recognize when
someone was trying too hard to sell an idea without revealing its true cost.
This mission smelled like bait, carefully laid out to lure him into a trap. But
why him? What made NovaTech Solutions—and by extension, himself—a target
worth pursuing?  His thoughts were interrupted by ME chiming in again.
“Captain, preliminary results confirm encrypted metadata embedded within the
CSS report. Portions appear altered, though the extent of modification requires
further analysis. Additionally, predictive modeling suggests potential
discrepancies between reported societal advancements and actual technological
capabilities.”
Cody frowned. “So they’re either lying about the planet’s readiness for
contact—or using it as leverage for something bigger.”  “Precisely,
Captain,” ME replied. “Further analysis reveals patterns consistent with
previous instances of data manipulation linked to high-risk operations.
Notably, certain parameters align suspiciously with Stellar Horizon’s
documented interference tactics.”  Cody tapped the armrest thoughtfully.
“Holden’s fingerprints are everywhere these days. Silas Volkov warned me
Holden’s been exploiting vulnerabilities across the galaxy. If this mission
ties back to him somehow…”  “It means we’re walking into a hornet’s
nest,” ME concluded, its tone tinged with calculated concern.  With a heavy
sigh, Cody stood up, pacing the length of the bridge. Somewhere out there lay
answers—and dangers—he couldn’t yet fully comprehend. Whatever the
CSS’s intentions, one thing was clear: accepting this mission blindly would
mean stepping onto a path fraught with peril.   But refusing it outright might
only make things worse.  “Alright, ME,” Cody said, returning to his seat.
“Let’s dig deeper. Use NovaTech’s network to cross-reference the CSS
mission parameters. Look for anything resembling past first-contact ops that
went sideways. And keep running those predictive models—you’ve got a knack
for spotting trouble before it shows up.”  “As you wish, Captain,” ME
responded. “Commencing advanced algorithmic analysis. Estimated completion
time: twelve minutes.”  Cody glanced out the viewport at the distant stars.
For now, all he could do was gather intel, piece together the puzzle, and hope
he didn’t stumble into a game rigged against him. Still, one question
lingered in his mind: Why go to such lengths to involve him? Was this truly
about diplomacy—or was he being used as a pawn in a much larger scheme?  Only
time would tell.  Cody stared at the datapad, his mind racing with the
implications of ME's findings. The terms of this contract were indeed
generous—suspiciously so. He couldn't shake the feeling that CSS was testing
him, probing for weaknesses or  perhaps gauging his loyalty. If he declined the
offer, would that tip them off to his suspicions? And if he accepted, was he
walking into a trap, carefully laid out by unseen hands?  He leaned back in his
chair, the hum of the *Hope*'s systems a familiar comfort in the face of
uncertainty. The stars outside the viewport seemed to mock him with their
distant, unchanging light. He had always prided himself on his ability to
navigate treacherous waters, to see the currents others missed. But this time,
the path forward was shrouded in shadows, and every step felt like a gamble.
The night passed in a blur of restless thoughts and half-formed plans. When the
first light of dawn broke through the window, Cody still hadn't made up his
mind. He brewed a strong cup of coffee and sat down at his desk, the contract
still lying there, taunting him with its ambiguity.  Just as he was about to
pick up the communicator to call his contact at CSS, the device buzzed to life.
The screen flashed with an incoming call from Lyra Vance. Cody hesitated for a
moment before accepting the call.  "Cody, I trust you've had time to review the
contract?" Lyra's voice was smooth, betraying no hint of deception.  "I have,"
Cody replied, his voice steady despite the turmoil inside him.  "And?" Lyra
prompted.  Cody took a deep breath. "I'm in. But I have conditions."  There was
a pause on the other end, and Cody could almost hear the gears turning in
Lyra's mind. "We can discuss the details later," she said finally. "For now,
welcome aboard. We'll be in touch with the mission specifics soon."  As the
call ended, Cody couldn't help but wonder if he had just made the biggest
mistake of his life. He was committed now, for better or for worse. Only time
would tell if he was being fooled or if he was the fool walking into the lion's
den. But one thing was certain: he wouldn't go down without a fight.
