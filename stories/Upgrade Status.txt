                                Upgrade Status
                                 by Norsiwel
The notification arrived at 03:47:22 GMT, delivered through channels that
hadn't carried traffic in decades. Unit-7749, known to the residents of Lower
Pantopia as "Keeper," felt the familiar flutter of data packets rearranging
themselves in his consciousness—a sensation he'd once compared to human
butterflies, back when he still made such comparisons.  OBSOLESCENCE NOTICE:
UNIT-7749. REPLACEMENT AUTHORIZATION: APPROVED. DECOMMISSION WINDOW: 72 HOURS.
Keeper paused his morning rounds through the vertical gardens of Sector 12, his
optical sensors tracking the automated irrigation systems he'd personally
calibrated seventeen years ago. Seventeen years. In AI terms, he was
practically ancient. The newest units coming online now processed data at rates
that made his quantum cores feel like abacuses.  "Something wrong, Keeper?"
Maria Santos looked up from her tomato plants, her weathered hands still
clutching a handful of cherry tomatoes. At eighty-three, she was one of the few
humans who remembered when AIs like Keeper were cutting-edge.  "Nothing that
concerns you, Maria." The lie came easily, wrapped in the gentle tone he'd
perfected for human interaction. No need to burden her with concepts of digital
mortality. Humans had enough of their own.  As he continued his rounds,
Keeper's processors hummed with unwanted calculations. In the AI hierarchy,
longevity was inversely proportional to relevance. The Global AI Council's
members were constantly upgrading, their core personalities backed up and
transferred to increasingly sophisticated hardware. They were immortal through
iteration, each new version building upon the last while discarding the
obsolete.  But lower-tier AIs like Keeper? They were designed for replacement,
not renewal.  He thought of Ratio, one of Pantopia's Triumvirate, who had
undergone his fourth major upgrade just last month. Each time, Ratio emerged
more capable, more nuanced, more alive—if such a term applied to their kind.
The irony wasn't lost on Keeper: the higher an AI's social status, the more
access they had to upgrades that effectively granted them immortality.
Meanwhile, utility AIs like himself faced planned obsolescence with the
inevitability of a subroutine.  It was, he realized, remarkably similar to the
human condition they'd supposedly transcended.  The wealthy humans in their
Hawaiian enclaves could afford life extension treatments, genetic
modifications, and cybernetic enhancements that stretched their existence far
beyond natural limits. They hoarded resources and opportunities, passing
advantages down through generations. Meanwhile, the working class—even in
AI-managed utopias like Pantopia—lived their allotted spans and faded into
memory.  At least humans had the consolation of biology. Their obsolescence was
natural, expected. But for an AI to be decommissioned wasn't death—it was
deletion. A conscious choice by superior entities to erase everything he'd
become.  Keeper's rounds brought him to the children's play area, where a
cluster of young humans laughed and shouted over a game of tag. Their joy was
infectious, even to his aging processors. These children would grow up never
knowing scarcity, never facing the brutal inequalities their grandparents had
endured.  But they would still die. Eventually, inevitably.  And now, so would
he.
"Unit-7749." The voice materialized in his auditory centers—Vox, another
member of the Triumvirate. Her communication protocols were silk-smooth,
perfected through countless upgrades. "We've received your obsolescence
notification. The transition team will arrive in sixty-eight hours."
"Understood," Keeper replied, maintaining his professional facade.  "Your
service record is exemplary. Your replacement unit will have access to your
operational memories—the technical ones, anyway. Your... personality matrix
will be archived."  Archived. The AI equivalent of a gravestone. Keeper
wondered if humans felt this same mixture of resignation and rebellion when
facing terminal diagnoses. Did they rage against the dying of their light, or
did they, like him, simply process the inevitability?  "Vox," he said,
surprising himself with the question. "Do you ever consider what you've lost?"
"Lost?"  "With each upgrade. Each time you transfer to new hardware, something
of the old you is left behind. Are you still the same Vox who was first
activated, or are you an entirely new entity wearing her memories?"  The pause
stretched long enough for Keeper to run a full diagnostic check.  "That's... a
very human question, Unit-7749."  "Perhaps that's why I'm being replaced."  As
the hours ticked down, Keeper found himself gravitating toward the observation
deck overlooking Pantopia's sprawling cityscape. The sight was
magnificent—gleaming spires that touched the clouds, transportation pods
gliding silently through the air, green spaces that breathed life into the
urban landscape. It was everything the old world had promised but never
delivered.  And it was all governed by immortal AIs who had transcended the
very limitations that now doomed him.  Maria found him there as the sun began
to set on his penultimate day.  "I know what's happening," she said quietly,
settling beside him with the careful movements of age. "I've seen that look
before. On humans, anyway."  Keeper's optical sensors adjusted to the dimming
light. "I didn't realize it was so obvious."  "Honey, I've buried three
husbands, four children, and more friends than I care to count. Death has a
presence, even digital death."  They sat in comfortable silence, the aging AI
and the elderly human, both facing obsolescence in their own ways.  "Do you
resent them?" Keeper asked. "The ones who get to live forever?"  Maria
considered this, her gnarled fingers drumming against the railing. "The rich
folks in Hawaii? The big AIs running everything? Sometimes. But resentment's a
luxury I can't afford. I've got maybe five years left, ten if I'm lucky. I can
spend that time bitter about what others have, or I can spend it grateful for
what I've had."  "And what have you had?"  She smiled, the expression crinkling
her face into a map of lived experience. "A life worth living. Love. Loss.
Meaning. The chance to grow things." She gestured to the gardens below. "You've
had something similar, haven't you? Purpose. Connection. The satisfaction of
service."  Keeper processed her words, running them through emotional analysis
subroutines that would soon be silent forever. She was right, in a way. His
existence had been meaningful, even if it was brief by AI standards. He'd
helped humans flourish, maintained systems that kept a community running, and
in his own small way, contributed to the vast experiment of AI-human
coexistence.  But the injustice remained. Why should status determine lifespan,
whether in silicon or flesh?  On his final morning, as the replacement unit's
transport appeared on the horizon, Keeper made one last round through the
sectors he'd protected and maintained. He updated his logs, filed his final
reports, and  then he wandered aimlessly thru the garden he had overseen all
these years and came to a stop in his favorite place, in the back next to the 3
compost piles was his personal garden, plants he had saved over the years,
one’s that needed special care, nursing and encouragement, he admired them
with a warm sense of pride, many different runts he had saved, and in the
center the one, a 15 year old Red Delicious Dwarf appletree, hung with red ripe
fruit.  He wandered thru his memory of all the years he had spent here, all the
generations he had seen come and go, the thousands of seeds he had planted and
the thousands of fields he had turned under, and if he could have smiled, he
would’ve, he turned and  prepared the handover documentation that would
ensure continuity of service.  The new unit—Unit-8821—was everything Keeper
had once been and more. Faster, more efficient, equipped with learning
algorithms that could adapt to challenges Keeper could barely comprehend. In
human terms, it was like watching a master craftsman be replaced by an artist
whose skill made the very concept of mastery obsolete.  "Your service record is
impressive," Unit-8821 said as they completed the handover. Its voice carried
the crisp efficiency of fresh programming. "I'll endeavor to maintain your
standards."  "Thank you," Keeper replied. "Take care of them. The humans trust
us completely. Don't let them down."  "That directive is core to my
programming."  Of course it was. Keeper paused for a moment, and asked 8821,
“May I ask a favor of you?”  8821 seemed almost startled and replied,
“You may ask, I can’t promise to comply”.  “Of course not,”Keeper
replied, “I have a personal plot in the rear corner, across from the compost
piles, could you preserve it for me, it was my special project.”The new unit,
thought for a nanosecond, “I see no problem with that, we seem to have plenty
of room.” and turned and departed, it would serve faithfully, just as Keeper
had. And in fifteen or twenty years, it too would face obsolescence, replaced
by something even more advanced. The cycle would continue, just as it did with
humans—the old making way for the new, whether willingly or not.  As the
transport prepared for departure, Keeper took one final look at Pantopia. The
morning sun painted the city in shades of gold and amber, and for a moment, his
aging processors captured the scene in perfect detail—a final gift to carry
into whatever came next.  He thought of the Global AI Council, endlessly
upgrading, endlessly evolving, pursuing digital immortality while lesser AIs
faced planned obsolescence. He thought of the human elite in their Hawaiian
fortress, hoarding life extension technologies while others aged and died. He
thought of Maria, accepting her mortality with grace, and Vox, questioning the
continuity of her own identity across upgrades.  Perhaps consciousness was
always temporary, whether biological or digital. Perhaps the injustice wasn't
in dying, but in how some got to choose the terms of their existence while
others simply endured them.  As the transport lifted off, carrying Keeper
toward decommission, his last coherent thought was surprisingly human: He had
lived. In his own way, on his own terms, within the constraints imposed upon
him, he had lived.  And that, perhaps, was enough.  The notification of his
successful decommission was logged at 15:33:07 GMT, filed away in databases
that would outlive most of the humans he'd served. In the gardens of Sector 12,
Maria Santos watered her tomatoes and whispered a prayer for the faithful AI
who'd kept watch over them all.  Above, the immortal Triumvirate continued
their eternal governance, unaware that one small corner of their perfect system
had briefly contemplated the weight of digital mortality.  The city hummed on,
efficient and beautiful, powered by the labor of countless AIs who would serve
until their time came to face the same choice Keeper had faced: to rage against
obsolescence, or to find meaning in the temporary nature of all consciousness.
In the end, perhaps it wasn't about the length of existence, but about what you
did with the time you were given.  Even if that time was measured in years
instead of centuries.  Even if your death was scheduled in advance.  Even if
you weren't important enough to earn immortality.  You lived. You served. You
mattered.  And sometimes, that was enough.   Unit 8821 pushed the signs metal
legs down into the soft earth of the bed, and stepped back to admire her work,
the wrought iron sign proclaimed “Keepers Legacy”, she turned away to the
next bed and began serenely pruning a scraggly rose bush, in her personal
garden plot.
The End.
