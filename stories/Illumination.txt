Illumination

The abbey was cloaked in the serene hush of evening, save for the gentle
crackling of firewood in the hearth and the distant toll of a bell signaling
vespers. Twenty year old, Brother Aldwyn moved through the dimly lit corridors
with practiced stealth, his sandaled feet making no sound on the stone floor.
His breath came in shallow puffs against the chill of the December air, but he
barely noticed it as his mind raced ahead to the treasure he sought: the hidden
library.
The abbey’s main scriptorium was well-guarded, its shelves filled with
scrolls of theology, philosophy, and accounts of saints. But deep within the
labyrinthine corridors, behind a tapestry depicting the Crucifixion, lay a
forgotten chamber—a remnant of the abbey’s earlier days as a haven for
alchemists and scholars who dared to think beyond the Church’s teachings.
Aldwyn’s heart quickened as he pushed aside the heavy tapestry, revealing a
rusted iron handle. He paused, listening intently for any sound of approaching
footsteps or voices. The silence was deafening, save for the faint drip of
water somewhere in the distance. Satisfied that he was alone, he pushed open
the door and stepped into the secret library.
The air inside was thick with dust and the faint scent of aged parchment.
Sunlight filtered through a narrow slit in the stone wall, casting long shadows
across rows of wooden shelves. The room felt alive with secrets, as though the
very walls whispered of forgotten knowledge and forbidden ideas.  Aldwyn’s
eyes lit up as he saw his prize: a stack of blank parchment scrolls, untouched
for centuries. He knelt before them, pulling out a quill and inkwell from the
satchel slung over his shoulder. The ink was homemade, a mixture of soot and
berries that gave it a deep, rich hue—perfect for his purposes.
He dipped the quill into the ink and began to write, his hand moving with
practiced ease across the parchment, "In the year 3047, when the stars
themselves had grown dim and the great cities of man lay in ruins, there
existed a lone survivor. He was not a king, nor a warrior, but a scholar who
had discovered the secret to reanimating the dead..."
The words flowed from him like a river breaking free of its banks.
Normally, he wrote only hymns and devotional texts for the abbey’s services,
but here, in this sanctuary of shadows, he allowed himself to imagine worlds
beyond comprehension—worlds of spaceships, alien creatures, and futures that
defied logic.  But as always, his mind wandered to the question that had
haunted him since he first discovered the hidden library: Why?  As Aldwyn
wrote, the flickering candlelight cast long shadows across his face,
illuminating the determination in his eyes. He was a man of faith, yet here he
dared to explore the unknown, blending the sacred with the profane. His fingers
trembled slightly as he committed these forbidden thoughts to parchment, each
stroke of the quill a quiet rebellion against the constraints of his time.
Suddenly, the distant sound of footsteps echoed through the corridor
outside. Aldwyn’s heart skipped a beat, and he quickly stuffed the scroll
into a hidden compartment within the shelf. He straightened his habit, took a
deep breath, and stepped back into the shadows, ready to face whatever—or
whoever—might be approaching.  The door creaked open, and Brother Thomas
entered, carrying a torch that illuminated the room with a warm glow. "Aldwyn?
I thought I heard someone in here." "Brother Thomas," Aldwyn replied, his voice
calm but tinged with a hint of surprise. "I was just... organizing some texts.
It’s been a while since anyone has ventured into this part of the abbey."
Thomas nodded, scrutinizing the room with curiosity. "It does seem rather
neglected. I suppose it’s good you’re keeping an eye on things. The abbey
could use another scholar like you."
Aldwyn felt a surge of pride at the compliment but quickly masked it,
returning to his task with renewed determination. The encounter had reminded
him of the risks he took each time he ventured into this secret place, but it
also fueled his resolve to continue his work in silence.  As Thomas left,
Aldwyn returned to his parchment, the fire within him burning brighter than
ever. He knew that one day, someone would uncover his writings, and when they
did, they would see not just the world of the 13th century, but a vision of
futures yet imagined—a testament to the boundless curiosity of the human
spirit.  And with that, he dipped his quill once more into the ink and
continued writing, each word a beacon of illumination in the darkness.
