Chapter 1: The Shard & The Shadow
The humid pre-dawn air of the Virginia piedmont clung to Aaron Vale like a
second skin, thick with the scent of damp earth and the metallic tang of ozone
from the approaching storm. He moved with an efficient leanness, a man built by
discipline, each step a quiet economy of motion that belied the tension
thrumming beneath his deep umber skin. His hair, short and practical, did
little to absorb the sheen of sweat beading on his forehead beneath the lip of
his helmet.  “Two minutes to perimeter breach,” crackled the voice of
Reyes, his second, in Vale’s earpiece. A dry, professional tone. Standard.
“Copy that, Ghost Lead,” Vale murmured back, his own voice a low baritone
that rarely rose above a controlled calm. “Viper team, final checks.
Remember, this is a soft knock until it ain’t. Intel says primary HVT is
research personnel, likely non-combatant. But assumptions get you bagged.”
His dark, alert eyes, features that seemed to absorb everything without giving
much away, scanned the dense treeline. Beyond it lay the sprawling, low-slung
architecture of the “West Creek Analysis Facility” – a deliberately bland
name for what Vale knew as Operation Stargate. A place where the bleeding edge
of neuroscience had, for years, danced a dangerous tango with national
security. And a place where, ironically, he’d once pulled a regular paycheck
just watching the damn gates.  Guard duty. Christ. A brief, unbidden image
flickered: a younger Vale, barely out of the Army’s grueling selection
process, stiff in a different kind of uniform, watching civilian cars roll
through the Stargate checkpoint. Back then, it had just been another stepping
stone, a way to get his foot further into the Agency’s door after a string of
deployments that had left him hungry for something… different. Something that
felt like it mattered beyond the next firefight. He’d thought the CIA was
that something. The naivete tasted like ash now.  He’d spent nearly three
years as a security officer at Stargate before his aptitude for more kinetic
work had been flagged, pulling him into the Special Activities Center. Three
years of watching the scientists come and go, of nodding politely to faces that
blurred into a montage of lab coats and distracted frowns. Except for one.
“Thirty seconds,” Reyes updated.  Vale pushed the flicker of Okafor’s
memory down. It had no place here. Not now. He focused on the layout of the
compound, mentally overlaying the blueprints he’d studied for the past twelve
hours. The mission was clear: infiltrate, secure HVT, extract. Standard
procedure. Except for the designation on this HVT – ‘Terminate on
Confirmation.’ That wasn’t standard for a research scientist, not even one
whose work brushed against the esoteric realms Stargate explored. And the final
target identification had come late, almost as an afterthought, pushed through
channels with unusual urgency and a worrying lack of detail. A bureaucratic
error, his handler, Mercer, had called it when he’d subtly questioned the
protocol violation of assigning an asset with prior non-operational contact
with the target. “Exigent circumstances, Vale. Just get it done.”  The
phrase had left a knot in his gut. The Agency was a creature of bureaucracy,
yes, but errors that put operatives in potentially compromised positions were
usually caught. Unless this wasn’t an error.  The compound fence, a ten-foot
chain-link topped with razor wire, loomed. His team – Viper Three and Viper
Four, Martinez and Chen – materialized like wraiths from the deeper shadows,
bolt cutters already at work. Vale gave a silent hand signal. The snip of metal
was almost inaudible.  “Perimeter breached, Ghost Lead. We are sterile.”
“Copy, Viper Actual. Proceed to entry point Alpha. Minimize signature.”  He
moved through the gap first, his M4 carbine held low, the world reduced to the
green-tinged landscape visible through his night vision goggles. His features,
usually set in an impassive mask, were taut with concentration. Every rustle of
leaves, every distant croak of a frog, was cataloged, assessed, and dismissed.
His mind, despite his efforts, drifted again. Not to the wide-eyed young
security guard, but to a specific rainy afternoon inside Stargate. He’d been
making his rounds in the research wing, the quiet hum of high-end electronics a
constant backdrop, when he’d found Dr. Okafor in her lab, staring at a
complex holographic display with an expression of fierce, almost desperate
concentration. He hadn’t meant to intrude, but she’d looked up, her
normally bright eyes clouded with fatigue.  “Officer Vale,” she’d said, a
hint of her British-Nigerian accent softening the institutional sterility.
“Can’t sleep?”  “Just making sure everyone else can, Doctor.”  A
ghost of a smile had touched her lips. She was a small woman, but her presence
filled the lab, fueled by an undeniable intellectual fire. “Right. Of
course.” She’d gestured vaguely at the swirling patterns of light in the
hologram. “It’s frustrating, you know? This… this thing.”  “The
memory project?” he’d asked, knowing only the broad strokes of her work –
something about mapping and interacting with neural pathways related to memory.
Her eyes had lit up, a spark of the passion that drove her. “Not just
interacting, Officer. Healing. Imagine… a soldier crippled by PTSD, a child
traumatized by loss. What if we could gently unspool those barbed-wire
memories, soften the edges, allow the mind to process them without being
re-traumatized? What if we could help them find peace?”  Her idealism had
been a stark contrast to the whispers he’d heard in the security break rooms
about potential ‘applications’ – enhanced interrogation, memory
alteration for ‘asset recruitment.’ Vale had listened, nodded, and filed it
away as another piece of the Stargate puzzle. Her sincerity, though, had stuck
with him. It had felt… pure. Something the Agency wasn't known for
cultivating.  “Approaching Entry Alpha,” Martinez whispered, his voice
tight. “No visual on sentries.”  Vale focused. Entry Alpha was a service
door, reinforced but not as heavily fortified as the main entrances. According
to the intel, it was alarmed, but Chen, their tech specialist, was prepped.
Chen knelt, a small device pressed against the doorframe. A few tense seconds
passed. “Alarm bypassed, Ghost Lead. Magnetic lock disengaged.”  Vale took
point again, easing the heavy door inward. The air inside was cooler, stale,
smelling faintly of ozone and floor wax. The corridor beyond was dimly lit by
emergency lights, a long, sterile tunnel.  “Viper Team, on me. Standard
spread. Eyes open.”  They moved like water, flowing down the corridor, their
footsteps muffled by their combat boots. Each door, each intersection, was
cleared with practiced efficiency. Vale felt the familiar rhythm of the
operation take over, the years of training manifesting in a deadly ballet of
observation and movement. His heart rate was steady, his breathing controlled.
This was his element. Yet, the unease persisted, a cold stone in his gut. The
“Terminate on Confirmation” order for a scientist… and the late, vague
target ID.  “Sector B secure,” Reyes reported. “Proceeding to Sector C.
Lab C-4 is our target.”  Lab C-4. Okafor’s lab. The cold stone in Vale’s
gut twisted. It can’t be. Mercer said an error, exigent circumstances… But
the coordinates were precise. There was no other Lab C-4.  He saw Chen tap his
helmet, indicating he was picking up something. “Ghost Lead, I’m reading
active comms traffic, encrypted. Sounds like internal security, but minimal
chatter. They’re not alerted to us, but they’re active.”  “Copy. Keep
it monitored. We stick to the plan.”  But what was the plan if the target was
Okafor? His mind replayed Mercer’s voice: “A violation of protocol…
Exigent circumstances, Vale. Just get it done.” Had she known it was Okafor
when she assigned him? Was this some grotesque test? Or simple, brutal
expediency?  They reached the antechamber to Lab C-4. The door was a heavy,
blast-resistant slab, its access panel dark. Chen went to work again, his
fingers flying over a compact datapad.  Vale scanned the corridor, his rifle a
natural extension of his arms. He could feel Martinez and Reyes flanking him,
their presence a  silent reassurance. His team was good. Loyal. They’d follow
his lead. But where was he leading them? Into a clean op, or something much
dirtier?  The memory of Okafor’s passionate explanation echoed: “…gently
unspool those barbed-wire memories… help them find peace.” How did that
reconcile with a kill order?  “I’m in,” Chen announced quietly. “Door
control acquired.”  Vale nodded. “On my mark. Flashbang ready, Martinez.”
Martinez primed the non-lethal device.  “Three… two… one… Execute.”
The blast door hissed open. Martinez tossed in the flashbang. A blinding flash,
a concussive thump. Vale was through the door before the echo died, M4
sweeping, NVGs momentarily whited out then recovering. Reyes and Martinez
followed, fanning out. Chen covered their six.  The lab was large, filled with
humming server racks and complex machinery. Holographic displays flickered,
casting ethereal blue light across the equipment. In the center of the room, by
a control console, a small figure was on the floor, hands over her ears,
disoriented by the flashbang.  As she looked up, her eyes wide with terror and
confusion, Vale’s breath hitched.  Dr. Amara Okafor.  Her hair was
disheveled, her lab coat askew. She looked smaller, more fragile than he
remembered. The fierce intellect was still there in her eyes, but now it was
overshadowed by raw fear.  “Target confirmed,” Mercer’s voice, cold and
dispassionate, suddenly filled Vale’s earpiece, overlaying the image of the
terrified woman before him. The timing was almost too perfect, too damning.
“Visual confirmation via your helmet cam, Viper Actual. You are weapons free.
Terminate the target.”  Vale’s world narrowed to the woman on the floor and
the chilling order in his ear. Terminate. Okafor. The woman who wanted to heal,
not harm. The woman he’d respected, whose quiet dedication had been a rare
point of light in the often-shadowed world of Stargate.  His finger tightened
on the trigger. Training screamed at him to obey. Years of conditioning. The
Agency’s first commandment: follow the order.  But another voice, quieter,
more insistent, rose from a deeper part of him. The part that had chosen the
military not just for the action, but to protect. The part that had listened to
Okafor’s dream of healing and believed it. The part that was sick of the
Agency’s righteous pronouncements masking its often-ruthless pragmatism.
Okafor’s eyes met his. Recognition flickered within the fear. “Vale…?”
she whispered, her voice trembling.  That one word, his name on her lips, was
the final catalyst.  He couldn’t do it.  Fuck Mercer. Fuck the Agency.
“Target is resisting!” Vale barked into his comm, his voice a sharp crack
of command that gave his team no time to question. He raised his rifle
slightly, firing a three-round burst into the reinforced wall just above
Okafor’s head. Sparks and concrete dust showered down. A purely theatrical
gesture. “Moving to subdue!”  Okafor flinched violently, whimpering.
“Viper Actual, what’s your status?” Mercer’s voice was sharp, laced
with suspicion. “Report!”  “Target attempting to activate…
something!” Vale improvised, stepping towards Okafor. He made eye contact, a
desperate, fleeting glance, hoping she’d understand, or at least play along.
“Don’t do it, Doctor!”  He reached her, his movements quick and decisive.
He didn’t grab her roughly; instead, his hand landed on her shoulder, firm
but not brutal. “Stay down!” he hissed under his breath, angling his body
to momentarily shield her from his helmet cam’s direct line of sight. He
pressed a nearly imperceptible shake into her shoulder. Play along.  To his
immense relief, she seemed to get it. Her initial terror solidified into a kind
of stunned compliance.  “Target neutralized!” Vale snapped into the comm,
pulling his sidearm and pressing the barrel gently, almost apologetically,
against Okafor’s temple, well out of her direct line of sight but visible to
his cam if he tilted his head. “Secured. She’s down.” He forced a
harshness into his tone he didn’t feel. The lie tasted bitter, but the
alternative was unthinkable.  A beat of silence from Mercer. Vale could
practically feel her unseen eyes boring into him through the fiber optic link.
“Confirm termination, Viper Actual.”  “Negative, Ghost Lead,” Vale
said, making a calculated risk. “She surrendered. Collapsed after the warning
shots. Minimal resistance once confronted directly. Requesting updated orders
for live extraction. Repeat, target is alive and secured for extraction.”  He
was walking a razor’s edge. Disobeying a direct kill order was grounds for
immediate disavowal, or worse. But he was betting on two things: the Agency’s
aversion to messy internal inquiries if an asset could be recovered, and
Mercer’s own potential desire to avoid the fallout of an operative blatantly
refusing a kill order on an HVT if she had plausible deniability.  Another
agonizing pause. His team remained in position, silent, watchful. He could feel
their questioning gazes even if he couldn’t see their faces clearly. Reyes,
Martinez, Chen – they were good soldiers. They were also human beings.
“Stand by, Viper Actual,” Mercer finally said, her voice flat, unreadable.
The storm was building.  Vale kept his sidearm near Okafor’s temple, playing
his role. “Don’t move, Doctor,” he murmured, then keyed his internal
comm, a separate channel to his team. “Viper team, perimeter secure. Eyes on
target. Martinez, check for any immediate threats, data wipes, anything. Chen,
scan for other life signs in this sector. Reyes, with me.”  Reyes moved to
his side. Vale gave him a subtle look. Reyes, ever the professional, just
nodded almost imperceptibly. He knew something was off, but he wouldn’t break
protocol unless Vale initiated it.  “Doctor,” Vale said, his voice low and
urgent, for her ears only, while keeping up the pretense for Mercer.
“There’s a service tunnel. North wall, behind the primary coolant manifold.
Old schematics. Leads out beyond the east perimeter. Can you make it?”
Okafor stared at him, comprehension slowly dawning in her wide, dark eyes.
Hope, fragile and tentative, flickered there too. She gave the smallest of
nods.  “Viper Actual,” Mercer’s voice cut back in, sharp as shattered
glass. “Revised orders. The asset is… unstable. Compromised. Potential for
data contamination is too high. Initial directive stands. Terminate. Confirm
kill.”  Vale’s blood ran cold. Unstable? Compromised? That was a death
sentence dressed up in jargon. Mercer was calling his bluff. Or worse, she
knew.  There was no more time for subtlety.  “Viper Team, comms blackout.
Execute emergency procedure Omega-Nine!” Vale snapped, his voice now ringing
with an authority that tolerated no dissent. Omega-Nine was a rarely used,
deeply buried protocol – immediate operational silence, severing helmet cams
and audio feeds to Command, enacted only in cases of suspected external comms
compromise or direct threat to the team’s integrity. It was a drastic
measure, almost an act of mutiny.  “Vale, what the hell?” Reyes hissed, his
professional calm finally cracking.  “No time, Ghost. Trust me.” He looked
at Okafor. “Go! Now! Don’t look back!” He holstered his sidearm, turning
his back on her for a precious second to face his team, projecting an
unwavering certainty he didn’t entirely feel. “Martinez, Chen, secure those
main lab consoles. Wipe anything active. Grab any loose data modules. Reyes,
cover that tunnel entrance once she’s clear! We exfil the same way if we have
to.”  He didn’t wait for their questions. He spun back. Okafor was already
scrambling towards the indicated wall, surprisingly agile. He prayed the tunnel
was still there, still accessible.  As his team, after a heartbeat of stunned
hesitation, moved to obey his rapid-fire orders – their trust in him, forged
over years of operations, overriding their confusion – Vale quickly scanned
the lab. His gaze fell on a workbench littered with prototypes and components.
Two devices, sleek and dark, unlike anything he’d seen, lay side by side.
They looked like modified optical scanners, small enough to be handheld, but
with intricate lenses and what appeared to be neuro-feedback sensors.
Okafor’s core research. The memory devices.  His mission parameters included
retrieval of all relevant project materials. These were undoubtedly relevant.
He snatched one, then hesitated. The protocol was clear: one team, one set of
secured evidence. But Mercer’s voice, her cold insistence on termination…
it reeked of a cover-up, of  something rotten. Disillusionment, a sentiment
that had been a slow burn for years, now flared into a cold, hard certainty. He
needed leverage. An escape hatch. Something for himself, if it all went south.
In a split second that felt like an eternity, he pocketed the second device,
tucking it into a spare pouch on his tac vest. He then picked up the first one,
making sure it was visible as he moved.  “Doc’s clear of the lab!” Reyes
called from the far side.  “Chen, Martinez, status!” Vale barked.
“Consoles being wiped. Found a detachable drive array, looks primary,” Chen
replied, his voice strained.  “Got another module here, detached, by what
looks like a charging station,” Martinez added.  “Good. Five minutes, then
we pull out. Rendezvous at the breach point. We go dark and quiet.”  He
looked towards the empty space where Okafor had vanished. He’d spared her,
disobeyed a direct order, and stolen a piece of classified technology. He’d
just painted a massive target on his own back. The adrenaline was a wild fire
in his veins, mixed with a chilling premonition.  The work friendship he’d
formed with Amara Okafor, the fragments of her idealistic explanations, her
passion for healing – they had been enough to make him throw away his career,
possibly his life. Or maybe, he thought grimly as he inventoried the single
device he would officially report, maybe he was just sick of being the
Agency’s blunt instrument, sent to erase problems and people without
question. Maybe he was just looking for a way out, and Amara Okafor had just
become his unwilling catalyst.  The weight of the second, hidden device pressed
against his ribs. A shard of something unknown, something powerful. And as he
prepared to lead his team out of the darkness of Stargate and into an uncertain
future, Aaron Vale knew, with a certainty that settled deep in his bones, that
nothing would ever be the same. The Agency would hunt him. And he, in turn,
would have to become something more than just a soldier. He’d have to become
a shadow.  The game had changed. And he was holding a piece he wasn't supposed
to have.
Chapter 2: A Feline Initiation
The aroma of burnt toast and cheap coffee – Elise’s morning ritual –
did little to dispel the sour taste of the Agency from Vale’s mouth. He sat
at their small Formica kitchen table, nursing a cup of lukewarm water, the
silence of their apartment amplifying the hum of the refrigerator. The city
beyond their cramped Arlington window was just beginning to stir, oblivious to
the tectonic shift that had occurred in his life. Yesterday, he was an
operative, a tool honed and wielded by unseen hands. Today, he was… on leave.
A euphemism that tasted like ashes.  Elise bustled in, a vibrant splash of
color in a floral dress, her blonde hair pulled back in a cheerfully
inefficient ponytail. She placed a plate with a blackened piece of bread and a
pat of rapidly melting butter in front of him. Her blue eyes, usually bright
with a kind of uncomplicated optimism, were clouded with concern.  “So,”
she began, perching on the edge of the opposite chair, her hands clasped in her
lap, a picture of misplaced solicitude. “You said… they want you to take
some time off?”  Vale had given her the abbreviated, heavily redacted
director’s cut last night. The sanitized version, fit for civilian
consumption. He’d recounted a mission with ‘unexpected operational
variables,’ leading to a ‘mandatory after-action review period,’ and his
‘proactive agreement’ to administrative leave. He’d carefully omitted the
muzzle flash of his lie, the chill of Mercer’s final order, the desperate
gamble with Okafor’s life, and, most significantly, the cool, illicit weight
of the second memory device currently nestled in the false bottom of his go-bag
like a sleeping viper.  “Yeah,” he said, his voice carefully neutral as he
prodded the carbonized offering on his plate. “Paid leave. Pending
investigation.” He made it sound like a sabbatical for the terminally
bureaucratic, a tedious but ultimately benign procedural knot.  Elise’s brow
furrowed with genuine sympathy, a small, worried crease between her perfectly
plucked eyebrows. “Oh, Aaron, that’s just awful. But… I mean, it’s just
an investigation, right? A formality? They’ll see you did everything by the
book. You always do.” Her faith in him was touching, in a naive, almost
heartbreaking way. Her faith in the Central Intelligence Agency, however, was
positively beatific. To Elise, the Agency was a pillar of rectitude, the
benevolent entity that had rescued her from the typing pool post-secretarial
school, granting her a respectable post as a receptionist in the marbled
grandeur of the main lobby. It was a realm of crisp suits, important phone
calls, and the satisfying heft of a government paycheck. It was emphatically
not a place where science was weaponized or where idealism went to die.
“Something like that,” Vale mumbled, taking a slow sip of water. Her
innocence was a curious thing, almost a relic from a forgotten age. Like trying
to explain quantum entanglement using only sock puppets. He wondered, not for
the first time, how they’d managed to share the same living space for nearly
two years, inhabiting such utterly different realities. Theirs was a
companionship of convenience, a silent treaty against loneliness, not a meeting
of minds. His mind, currently, was a locked room she didn’t even know
existed.  “Well, they’re looking out for you, then,” Elise continued, her
optimism, bless its cotton socks, kicking into high gear as she found the
silver lining. “Making sure everything’s squared away after a tough op. The
Agency looks after its own, Aaron. You know that. Remember when Mr. Henderson
in Accounts Receivable had that unfortunate incident with the rogue colon? They
made sure he had the best surgeons, top-notch care, didn't they?”  Vale
nodded, a hollow bob of his head. Mr. Henderson, to the best of his knowledge,
hadn’t disobeyed a direct order from a vindictive handler while liberating
classified experimental technology. The Agency looked after its own, true
enough – so long as ‘its own’ remained predictable, pliable cogs in the
great machine. He, Aaron Vale, was rapidly grinding against the gears.
“Maybe this will be a blessing in disguise,” she mused, her voice
brightening, practically radiating sunshine and tax-payer funded goodwill. “A
little break. A staycation! We could finally take that weekend trip to Luray
Caverns you’re always saying we’re too busy for. Or you could just…
relax. Unwind. Binge that Scandinavian crime drama I downloaded.” She reached
across the small table, her fingers briefly, tentatively, touching his arm. Her
touch was light, a feather duster attempting to soothe a caged tiger.  Vale
manufactured a tight, unconvincing smile. “Yeah. Relax.” The word felt like
a foreign language, a concept from a distant, untroubled planet. His mind was a
buzzing hive of worst-case scenarios, escape routes, and the insistent,
magnetic pull of the stolen device. Relaxing wasn’t just off the agenda; it
wasn’t even in the same building.  “They’ll sort it out, sweetie,”
Elise declared with a confidence he almost envied, standing and smoothing down
her floral battlefield of a dress. “You’re one of their best. A real
company man. Mercer knows that. Everyone does.” She paused, a tiny seed of
doubt finally sprouting in her relentlessly fertile optimism as she registered
his less-than-enthusiastic demeanor. “Won’t they?”  He met her expectant,
hopeful gaze. He saw the carefully curated, comfortably furnished world she
inhabited, a world where her live-in boyfriend was a steadfast hero employed by
an unequivocally good-hearted organization. To detonate that delusion with the
raw, unvarnished truth would be an act of needless cruelty. And, more
pragmatically, entirely pointless. She couldn’t help him. The cavalry
wasn’t coming, at least not for him. His only potential allies now were a
fugitive scientist and the dark, unknown potential of the technology he’d
purloined.  “Sure, Elise,” he said, his voice a carefully constructed
monotone. “They’ll sort it out.” Like a tangled fishing line, he thought.
With a very sharp knife.  She offered a slightly strained smile in return,
collected her purse – a riot of faux leather and improbable buckles – and
headed for the door. “Well, try not to let it get you down. I’ll call you
on my lunch break, okay?” A quick, dry peck on his cheek, redolent of
drugstore talcum powder and blind faith, and she was gone. Swallowed by the
hallway, off to her world of polite efficiency and neatly routed calls, leaving
Vale adrift in the sudden, ringing silence of their shared apartment, alone
with his carefully constructed lies, his stolen future, and the pressing weight
of his new, unsanctioned reality.  The burnt toast remained, a silent,
carbonized monument to their morning’s disconnect. His ‘leave’ had
officially, and ominously, begun.  The click of the front door latch was
Vale’s cue. He waited another sixty seconds, a habit ingrained from years of
needing to be certain of solitude, then rose. The burnt toast went into the
bin. The charade of normalcy was over.  His go-bag lay innocuously by the coat
stand. To Elise, it was just luggage. To Vale, it was a mobile armory, a
survival kit, and now, a Pandora’s Box. He retrieved it, carried it into
their small bedroom, and clicked the door shut. The blinds were already drawn,
casting the room in stripes of grey morning light.  He knelt, unzipped a
secondary compartment, and pushed aside a neatly folded set of civilian
clothes. There, nestled in a padded recess he’d cut into the lining years ago
for just such a contingency – though he’d never imagined this specific
contingency – was the second device. Dr. Okafor’s brainchild. His
albatross. His potential ace in the hole.  It was about the size of a high-end
electric shaver, sleek and matte black, fitting comfortably in his palm. One
end flared slightly, housing a complex array of what looked like micro-lenses
and emitters, veiled behind a protective, almost opaque crystal. The other end
tapered to a handgrip, subtly contoured. There were no visible seams, no
obvious ports for charging or data transfer, save for a tiny, recessed reset
stud that would require a pin. Its surface was cool, almost unnervingly smooth,
absorbing light rather than reflecting it. Austere. Enigmatic. And utterly
without instruction.  And then there was the button.  One singular, prominent
button, located precisely where his thumb would naturally rest. Large,
circular, slightly concave. It was the only interactive element visible. He
pressed it experimentally. It yielded with a soft, almost organic click, a
momentary contact switch that only stayed depressed as long as he held it.  He
held it for a five-count. Nothing. No lights, no sounds, no tactile feedback.
He released it. Still nothing.  A frown creased Vale’s brow. He wasn’t a
scientist, but he was a master of understanding systems, of reverse-engineering
intent from design. Okafor was brilliant; her tech wouldn't be pointlessly
obtuse. There had to be a logic to it.  He ran his thumb over the button again.
Proximity? Perhaps it needed to be near… something. An active neural field?
He remembered Okafor’s words: “…unspool those barbed-wire memories…”
Memories were of minds. Maybe it needed a mind to dance with. But whose? And
how close a dance?  His own, perhaps? He held the device against his temple,
lens-end first, and pressed the button. Again, he counted to five. Again, the
profound, frustrating absence of anything. He tried the back of his neck, the
base of his skull, even aiming it vaguely at his reflection in the darkened
window, feeling increasingly foolish. This wasn’t exactly cracking enemy
codes. This was basic user interface, and he was failing spectacularly. Perhaps
the thing was inert, a dud. Or maybe, more worryingly, it required a specific
activation sequence he didn’t possess. Or perhaps he was just… out of his
depth, a grunt playing with a scalpel. Food for thought, indeed.  A soft thud
from the hallway, followed by a plaintive, questioning meow. Vale sighed.
Pookey.  Elise’s cat. A ginger tabby of indeterminate lineage and an
overdeveloped sense of entitlement. The creature was, in Vale’s private
estimation, a furry little freeloader with the survival instincts of a throw
pillow. But Elise doted on him. Therefore, Pookey was an unavoidable fixture in
their domestic landscape.  The scratching at the bedroom door was tentative at
first, then more insistent. Another meow, this one carrying a distinct note of
impatient demand.
“Alright, alright,” Vale muttered, rising to open the door. His mind was
still snagged on the device. He couldn’t afford to be stymied by a button.
Pookey sauntered in as if he owned the place, which, in many ways, he did. Tail
held high like a periscope, he surveyed the room, then, spotting Vale, let out
a soft, manipulative chirp and made a beeline for the bed, leaping onto the
duvet with surprising grace for such a pampered creature. He began to purr, a
rumbling motor of contentment, head-butting Vale’s leg, demanding his morning
quota of affection.  Vale absently stroked the cat’s head, his gaze returning
to the device still in his other hand. It was probably foolish, but the thought
nagged: an active neural field. Pookey, for all his pampered indolence,
undoubtedly possessed one. A simpler one, perhaps, less cluttered with
existential dread and Agency protocols than Vale’s own, but a mind
nonetheless.  “Alright, you little opportunist,” Vale murmured, sitting on
the edge of the bed. Pookey immediately intensified his purring, rubbing
insistently against Vale’s hand. “Let’s try this one more time. For
science. Or something.”  He positioned the device, lens-end pointing roughly
towards Pookey’s head, a distance of maybe half a meter. The cat, oblivious,
was now attempting to knead Vale’s thigh into submission. Taking a breath,
feeling a strange mix of skepticism and a prickle of… something else…
anticipation?… Vale pressed the button again.  For a heart-stopping second,
nothing. Just the rhythmic thrum of Pookey’s purr. Vale was about to curse
his own foolishness when it happened.  Not a light. Not a sound. But a shift.
A lurching, visceral, brain-scrambling displacement.  The world didn’t so
much change as reconfigure. The muted greys and browns of the bedroom didn’t
vanish; they were… less. Less relevant. What exploded into his sensorium was
a kaleidoscope of other things. The smell of the room, for instance. Not the
faint, lingering scent of Elise’s drugstore perfume or the sterile undertone
of his own gun oil, but a complex tapestry: the rich, musky sweetness of
sun-warmed duvet, the tantalizing, almost electric ghost of outside clinging to
Vale’s jeans, the faint, dusty promise of something edible forgotten under
the dresser. His own familiar human scent was there too, but layered, a
composite of salt and skin and the intriguing, faintly metallic tang of… was
that frustration? Yes, a faint, buzzing undercurrent from the big, warm
creature beside him.  And the sounds! The quiet hum of the refrigerator he’d
noted earlier was a booming, resonant drone. The distant traffic, previously a
muted whisper, became a symphony of individual growls and hisses. A fly,
unnoticed by Vale, buzzed near the window, each wingbeat a distinct, percussive
thrum.  Then came the sight. The colors were… different. Less red, more blues
and greens, and an astonishing ability to pick out movement. The motes of dust
dancing in the slivers of light from the blinds weren’t just dust; they were
a swirling, captivating ballet. His own hand, still resting on Pookey’s
flank, looked enormous, a pale, clumsy mountain range.  He was Pookey.  Not in
a metaphorical sense. He was the cat. The physical sensation of fur against his
skin was now the sensation of his own fur. The comfortable weight on the bed
was his own body. The insistent rumble in his chest was his purr, a deep,
resonant vibration of pure, uncomplicated contentment.  And then, overlaid on
the lazy morning affection, a memory. Not his memory. Pookey’s.  It bloomed
with an astonishing, almost painful vividness, a perfect, immersive replay.
Sunlight, warm on his ginger fur. Not the filtered stuff of indoors, but the
real deal, dappled and alive, in the small, overgrown patch of shared apartment
garden Elise sometimes let him explore under strict supervision. The air
thrummed with life. The rich scent of damp soil, the perfume of nameless
flowers, the high, thin buzz of insects. His whiskers twitched, decoding a
universe of information. And then…  Movement!  A flicker at the edge of his
vision. Small, dark, fluttering. Adrenaline, pure and unadulterated, flooded
his small body. Instinct, ancient and unerring, took over. His powerful hind
legs bunched. Every muscle coiled. His pupils, already wide in the dimmer light
of his cat-vision, dilated further, focusing with laser precision. The world
narrowed to that single, darting target.  A bird. A small, foolishly bold
sparrow, pecking at something near the wilting rose bush.  The stalk. Low to
the ground, belly almost brushing the cool earth. Each paw placed with infinite
care, silent, meticulous. The purr was gone now, replaced by a focused, almost
prayerful stillness. The sparrow, oblivious, chirped.  Closer. The scent of
feathers, dry and dusty, filled his nostrils. He could see the individual barbs
on its wing, the quick, nervous beat of its tiny heart, a frantic metronome
against the backdrop of the larger world. He was a shadow, a whisper of intent.
The calculation. Distance. Trajectory. The precise, explosive launch.  And
then, pure, kinetic poetry. A blur of ginger fur and lethal grace. The earth
fell away. For a glorious, suspended moment, he was airborne, a tiny, furry
missile locked onto its destiny. There was no thought, no doubt, only the pure,
ecstatic execution of an ancient program.  Impact. A soft, feathered thud. The
satisfying crunch – not of bone, this was too quick, too clean – but of…
life interrupted. A flurry of frantic, useless wingbeats against his jaws. The
taste of it – wild, vital, a tiny spark extinguished. Triumph. Not cruel, not
malicious, just… right. This was what he was. This was the peak, the
glorious, bloody-minded apex of his existence.  The memory faded, not abruptly,
but like a dream upon waking, leaving behind the lingering, ghostly echo of
exhilaration and the faint, coppery tang of something that might have been
blood, or perhaps just the raw, primal essence of a successful hunt.  Vale
gasped, releasing the button. The world snapped back. Or rather, he snapped
back, hurled from the visceral reality of Pookey’s sun-dappled garden
execution into the muted, bewildered confines of his own mind, his own body.
He was on the floor, on his hands and knees, panting. The device lay beside
him. Pookey, startled by his sudden movement, had leaped off the bed and was
now regarding him from the safety of the doorway, tail bushed out, eyes wide
and accusatory, emitting a series of low, guttural growls. The purr was
definitely gone.  “Holy… shit,” Vale breathed, his heart hammering
against his ribs. His own senses felt dull, muffled, like trying to see through
a fogged-up window after looking through a high-powered lens. The air in the
bedroom was flat, odorless by comparison. The sounds were… just sounds.  He
stared at the device, then at the indignant cat. Okafor hadn't been developing
a healing tool. She’d been crafting a goddamn crowbar for the soul.  The
proximity. He’d been practically touching Pookey when it activated. And the
intensity… it hadn't been like watching a film. He was the cat. He'd felt
every twitch of whisker, every beat of that tiny, doomed bird's wing. It was a
total sensory download, a full immersion. A theft.  He scrambled back onto the
bed, his mind racing, trying to process the deluge. He picked up the device
again, its cool, impassive surface now feeling profoundly different, humming
with a terrifying, intoxicating potential. The single button mocked him with
its simplicity.  So that was the secret. Not just a mind, but a mind close
enough. The official documentation for Stargate – the bits he’d been privy
to – had talked about ‘neural interface parameters’ and ‘synaptic
resonance fields,’ all very dry and academic. They hadn’t mentioned
anything about hijacking the consciousness of a pissed-off ginger tabby. This
little beauty wasn't some delicate instrument for therapeutic realignment; it
was a bloody skeleton key.  A strange, disquieting thrill, sharp and dangerous,
began to uncoil in his gut, mixing with the lingering adrenaline of Pookey’s
triumphant kill. It was the rush he’d almost forgotten, the high-wire act of
discovery, of stepping into the unknown. This device wasn't just leverage. It
was… power. A terrifying, intoxicating power to step outside himself, to
experience the world through senses untainted by his own weariness, his own
disillusionment.
He looked at his own hands, then around the familiar, suddenly claustrophobic
confines of the bedroom. The sterile silence pressed in. The ‘paid leave’
stretched before him, a desert of inactivity and mounting paranoia. The Agency
would be digging. Mercer would be dissecting his every past action. He was a
loose end, a complication.  But now… now he had something they didn't know
about. Something that could change the game. He just had to understand it.
Master it. And to do that, he needed more data. More experiences.  Pookey,
still bristling in the doorway, let out a final, disgusted chirp and stalked
off, probably to lodge a formal complaint with the carpet. Vale barely noticed.
He needed to get out. He needed to walk. He needed to see what this
incredible, terrible little device could really do when pointed at something
more complex than a domestic feline with a taste for avian slaughter.  The city
awaited. A veritable playground of unsuspecting minds.  And Aaron Vale, an
agent on leave, a man teetering on the edge of something profound and perilous,
felt the first, insidious stirrings of a new, insatiable hunger. The world
outside was a library, and he had just found the only key.
Chapter 3: The Grieving Mother
The Pookey incident, as Vale was now grimly terming it in his own mind, had
been a revelation. The sheer, unadulterated fidelity of the experience – the
sun on ginger fur, the primal thrill of the hunt, the metallic tang of the kill
– had left him shaken and exhilarated in equal measure. It was more than
watching a recording; it was being. The stolen device wasn't just a data
retrieval tool; it was a portal. And like any newly discovered portal, the urge
to step through it again was becoming a gnawing, insistent pressure.  His
‘leave’ stretched before him, a barren landscape of forced inactivity and
the looming threat of Agency scrutiny. Mercer would be dissecting his report,
cross-referencing his comms, looking for the cracks. He needed to understand
this device, to master it, before they came for him. And if he was going to
understand it, he needed to be methodical. Systematic. The soldier in him, the
operative, demanded it.  The first step was documentation. The city, still
yawning into its Tuesday morning, offered anonymity. He found a small,
old-fashioned stationer’s shop tucked between a dry cleaner and a coffee
house whose windows were fogged with steam. The bell above the door tinkled a
cheerful, anachronistic welcome. He bought a slim, black Moleskine notebook –
pocket-sized, unlined – and a couple of fine-tipped pens. Mundane tools for
an extraordinary purpose.  Back in the relative anonymity of a bustling city
park, he found a bench slightly removed from the main flow of joggers and
dog-walkers. He opened the journal to its first virgin page.  Device Alpha
(Stolen Unit), Initial Observations.  Subject: Feline, Domestic Shorthair
(Pookey). Proximity: ~0.5m. Activation: Instantaneous. Button press
(momentary). Immersion: Total sensory and emotional overlay. Duration:
~5-second press resulted in approx. 2-minute memory playback. No discernible
after-effects on subject (beyond acute indignation). No discernible
after-effects on operator (beyond profound disorientation and nascent craving).
He paused, the word ‘craving’ stark on the page. He crossed it out.
Profound intellectual curiosity. Better. More professional. More… deniable,
even to himself.  He needed a human subject. Pookey was a simple creature, his
motivations clear, his memories, while vivid, were uncomplicated. Humans were a
messy knot of contradictions, regrets, joys, and sorrows. A far richer data
set. But who? And how? The subway encounter had been random, a fleeting
experiment. Now he needed intent.  His gaze drifted. People passed by, each a
self-contained universe of experience. A businessman barked into his phone,
radiating stress. A young couple laughed, tangled in each other’s orbits. And
then, he saw her.
A woman sat alone on a park bench opposite a small, slightly faded children’s
playground, a study in stillness amidst the midday bustle. She wasn't old,
perhaps early forties, dressed in muted, sensible clothes that seemed to absorb
the light rather than reflect it. Her hands were clasped tightly in her lap,
her gaze fixed on the empty swings moving slightly in the breeze, as if willing
them to be occupied. There was a sag to her shoulders, an invisible weight
pressing her down. Even from this distance, Vale could feel the aura of
desolation emanating from her, a cold, quiet vacuum.  A pang, sharp and
unwelcome, pierced through Vale’s burgeoning intellectual curiosity about the
device. Grief. He knew its contours intimately, the hollow ache, the way it
could leach the color from the world. His sister, Sarah. A flash of faded
denim, a gap-toothed grin, the screech of tires on a rain-slicked road when he
was barely a teen. A wound that time had scabbed over but never truly healed.
This woman’s pain resonated with that old, buried frequency within him.  And
a new thought, insidious and compelling, slid into his mind. Okafor had spoken
of healing. Of unspooling barbed-wire memories. What if… what if he could
take this woman’s pain away? Just for a moment. A test, of course. For
science. But also… a kindness? He wasn't a monster. He was… a liberator. A
surgeon of sorrow. The justification felt surprisingly comfortable, settling
over his unease like a warm blanket. She’d be better off without it, surely.
The pleasure of the Pookey experience, the god-like feeling of stepping outside
himself, pulsed beneath the surface, a dark, thrilling undercurrent to his
altruistic rationale.  He rose, journal tucked into his jacket, and ambled
casually towards her bench, as if merely seeking a place to rest. He sat at the
far end, giving her space, observing her peripherally. Her eyes, when she
briefly glanced his way, were shadowed, haunted. Perfect.  He waited for a lull
in the foot traffic, then, feigning a stretch, brought his hand, the device
concealed within it, closer to her. Less than a meter. Closer. He leaned back,
arm resting along the back of the bench, the device now mere inches from her
head. She didn’t react, lost in her private desolation.  He pressed the
button.  The park dissolved.  The smell of antiseptic. The relentless, rhythmic
beeping of a heart monitor. A small, still hand in hers, shockingly cold.
“I’m so sorry, Mrs. Albright. We did everything we could.” The doctor’s
voice, kind but distant, a pronouncement from another world. Her own voice, a
ragged whisper, “No… no, not my Jamie… please…” The crushing weight
on her chest, a physical agony, as if her own heart were being torn out. The
sterile white room. The single, wilting flower in a plastic vase on the bedside
table. Jamie’s favorite blue teddy bear, clutched tight in her other hand,
its button eyes staring blankly. The silence. The terrible, echoing silence
after the beeping stopped.  The memory was a raw, open wound, a torrent of
undiluted anguish. Vale felt it all – the disbelief, the denial, the searing
pain of a love ripped away. It was suffocating, a drowning wave of sorrow. He
felt tears, not his own, prickle his eyes. He was her. He was Mrs. Albright,
and her son was gone.  He released the button, gasping, stumbling back into
himself as if surfacing from a deep, dark ocean. The park snapped back into
focus, vibrant and jarringly normal. He was panting slightly, his own heart
hammering.  The woman beside him stirred. A flicker in her eyes. A slow blink.
Then, a frown, not of sorrow, but of… puzzlement. She touched her cheek, as
if surprised to find it dry. She looked at the empty swings, her expression
shifting from deep-seated pain to a kind of vague, questioning emptiness. The
terrible weight he’d vicariously experienced seemed to have lifted, or at
least, lessened considerably. She looked lighter, somehow. Still sad, perhaps,
but the acute, crippling edge of her grief seemed… blunted.  She stood up,
smoothed her skirt, gave one last, confused look at the playground, and then
walked away, her steps a little less heavy than before.  Vale watched her go, a
strange mix of emotions churning within him. The echo of her pain was still a
residue in his mind, but beneath it, the familiar, intoxicating rush was
building. The power of it. To step into a soul, to witness its deepest truths,
to even, perhaps, alter its landscape. He had taken her agony. He had, in his
own twisted way, helped.  He pulled out his journal, his hand not quite steady.
Subject: Human, Female, approx. 40s (Albright?). Memory Type: Acute Grief
(Child Loss – ‘Jamie’). Proximity: ~0.2m. Activation: Instantaneous.
Immersion: Overwhelming. Duration of press: ~3 seconds. Estimated memory
length: ~1 minute. Effect on Subject: Apparent confusion, reduction in visible
distress. Operator: Significant emotional transference. And exhilaration.  He
crossed out ‘exhilaration.’ Significant psycho-sensory feedback.  That
evening, Elise chattered about her day – a misfiled report, a new directive
about visitor badges, Mr. Henderson’s latest colonoscopy follow-up. Vale
nodded, made the appropriate murmurs of interest, his mind a universe away. He
felt the phantom weight of Mrs. Albright’s hand clutching a blue teddy bear,
the ghost of antiseptic in his nostrils.  Later, in the dim light of their
bedroom, Elise reached for him. Her touch was warm, familiar, her scent a known
quantity of drugstore lotion and laundry detergent. He went through the
motions, a well-rehearsed choreography. But it was a hollow performance. Her
skin felt alien against his, her pleasure a distant signal. His mind, however,
was miles away, replaying the intoxicating symphony of another’s sorrow, now
silenced by his hand. The intimacy he’d experienced with Mrs. Albright, a
complete stranger, albeit a stolen, violating intimacy, felt more profound,
more real, than anything he now felt with the woman in his arms.  Her touch was
distant, almost an abstraction, while the phantom touch of a child’s small
hand, a memory not his own, still tingled on his mental fingertips. The stark
contrast was unsettling. He was living on two planes now: the mundane reality
of his life with Elise, and the vibrant, terrifying, addictive world of stolen
moments.  He knew, with a certainty that both thrilled and terrified him, that
this was only the beginning. The craving was already returning, a persistent
whisper promising power, escape, and a god-like glimpse into the hidden hearts
of others. The journal lay on his nightstand, its blank pages calling to him.
So many stories, so much pain, so much life, waiting to be collected.
Chapter 4: The Weight of Shadows
The antiseptic chill of the hospital room was the first thing to pierce
the veil of sleep. It clung to Vale, not as a memory observed, but as a present
reality. He was standing, or rather, floating, just behind Mrs. Albright. He
saw her hand, raw and red from clenching, engulfing the small, impossibly still
hand of her son, Jamie. The rhythmic, electronic beep of the heart monitor was
a deafening, metronomic countdown to silence. He felt the leaden weight in her
chest, the desperate, silent scream trapped in her throat, the jagged edges of
a love being forcibly, brutally severed.  “I’m so sorry, Mrs. Albright. We
did everything we could.”  The doctor’s voice was his own. Aaron Vale’s
voice, low and controlled, delivering the death knell. But he was also Mrs.
Albright, his own words a hollow pronouncement from an indifferent universe.
The duality was sickening, a möbius strip of grief where observer and sufferer
were one. He tried to look away, to pull back, but he was anchored, a spectator
chained to the stage of her agony.  Then the scene shifted, the cold, sterile
white of the hospital room bleeding into the murky greens and browns of a
rain-slicked forest trail he hadn’t thought of in years. He was younger,
barely a man, soaked to the bone. The rain was a percussive, unending drumbeat
against the hood of his cheap poncho. And there, ahead of him, a smaller
figure, a flash of faded denim and bright, impossible yellow rain boots. Sarah.
His sister. She turned, her gap-toothed grin radiant even in the dreary light.
“Come on, slowpoke!” her voice echoed, young and carefree.  Then, the
sound. Not tires this time, but something else. A crack, sharp and sudden, like
a branch snapping under immense pressure. And Sarah… Sarah was Jamie, lying
in the hospital bed, her skin pale, her chest still. The blue teddy bear Mrs.
Albright had clutched was now in his hands, its button eyes staring up at him
with vacant accusation. The antiseptic smell mingled with the loamy scent of
wet earth and decaying leaves.  “We did everything we could, Aaron.” This
time, it was Mercer’s voice, cold and precise, overlaying the image of his
sister, of Jamie, of a grief so profound it threatened to swallow him whole.
“But assumptions get you bagged.”  Vale woke with a strangled gasp,
drenched in sweat, the cheap sheets of his and Elise’s bed twisted around him
like a shroud. His heart hammered against his ribs, a wild bird trapped in a
cage. The phantom smells of antiseptic and damp earth lingered in his nostrils,
a nauseating miasma. He sat bolt upright, his breath coming in ragged, shallow
bursts. The details of the nightmare were already beginning to fade, but the
emotional residue clung to him, a viscous, chilling film of sorrow and
helplessness. It wasn’t his sorrow, not entirely, yet it felt sickeningly
familiar, grafted onto the old, scarred tissue of his own past losses.  He
fumbled for the light, the sudden yellow glare chasing away the worst of the
shadows but doing little to dispel the icy dread in his gut. Elise murmured in
her sleep, turning away from the light, oblivious. He looked at her, a wave of
profound alienation washing over him. How could he even begin to explain the
terrain he now traversed nightly?  The stolen device lay on his nightstand,
innocently matte black beside his journal. His hand, trembling slightly,
reached for the journal first. He needed to anchor himself, to draw a line in
the sand of his own sanity.  Entry: 03:47 hrs. Post-Nightmare Event. Subject
Memory: Albright (Jamie). Cross-contamination with personal trauma (Sarah).
Vivid sensory and emotional bleed-through. Experience… debilitating.  He
paused, the pen hovering. Debilitating wasn’t strong enough. Terrifying.
Invasive.  Attempting to compartmentalize. The device facilitates total
immersion. Side effect: potential for uncontrolled mnemonic integration during
REM sleep. The subject’s grief (Albright) is potent, possessing an almost
viral capacity to latch onto existing emotional vulnerabilities in the
operator. This is not clean. This is… messy.  He reread the last line. Messy.
An understatement that bordered on the absurd. His carefully constructed
internal defenses, honed by years of military discipline and Agency protocol,
were being eroded, not by external threats, but by the borrowed anguish of
strangers. The sterile, objective language of his journal entries felt like a
flimsy shield against a tidal wave. He was trying to map an earthquake with a
child’s crayon.  But even as the fear and revulsion churned within him,
another sensation, darker and more insidious, began to stir. A faint echo of
the power, the god-like trespass of stepping into another’s soul. The
nightmare was a price, yes, but for what a prize. The thought was a shameful,
thrilling secret.  The compulsion to use the device again, to wash away the
lingering horror of the dream with a fresh, potent dose of another’s reality,
was already a dull ache in his chest. He pushed it down, forcing himself to
focus on the practical. This uncontrolled bleed-through was a problem. A
significant one. It threatened his operational capability – if he even had
one left outside the Agency’s direct purview – and more pressingly, his own
identity. He needed to maintain the boundaries. The journal was a start, an
attempt to objectify, to dissect, but it wasn’t enough.  He needed to get
out, to walk, to feel the concrete reality of the city beneath his feet.  The
subway station hummed with its usual morning energy: a river of humanity
flowing towards work, school, appointments. Vale stood near a tiled pillar,
ostensibly reading a discarded newspaper, but his eyes, sharp and assessing,
scanned the crowds. He felt the subtle weight of the memory device in his
jacket pocket, his fingers almost unconsciously tracing its smooth, cool
contours. He was looking for them now, the ones whose faces betrayed an inner
turmoil, whose shoulders sagged under invisible burdens. His ‘subjects.’
The term still felt clinical, detached, a necessary fiction to maintain his own
equilibrium.  He saw her first: an older woman, sixty-something, with neatly
coiffed silver hair and a determined set to her jaw. She clutched a large,
expensive-looking leather handbag to her chest, her knuckles white. Her gaze
darted nervously, assessing the throng, a hint of apprehension in her eyes. And
then he saw him: a young man, early twenties, thin and wiry, with restless,
hungry eyes. He wore a threadbare hoodie, the hood pulled low, but it did
little to conceal the predatory focus in his gaze as it locked onto the
woman’s handbag.  Vale watched the young man detach himself from the flow,
his movements becoming slinky, almost serpentine, as he began to shadow the
woman. Classic pickpocket stalk. Opportunistic. Vale felt a flicker of his old
professional self, the hunter’s instinct. But it was quickly overlaid by a
new, more complex urge.  The young man was closing the distance, the woman
oblivious, fumbling in her bag, likely for her transit pass. The platform was
crowded, the perfect environment for a swift, unseen lift. The thief’s hand,
thin and grimy, began to emerge from his pocket, fingers twitching.  Vale
moved, not with the explosive force of an operative neutralizing a threat, but
with a calculated, almost casual drift, bringing him within a meter of the
young man, just as the thief’s body tensed, ready to make his move. Vale’s
thumb found the button.  Crack! Not a sound, but a sensation. The memory hit
Vale like a fist to the gut, sharp and brutal, a stark contrast to the diffuse
sorrow of Mrs. Albright.  A cramped, squalid room. The reek of stale beer and
unwashed bodies. A man’s voice, thick with rage and cheap whiskey, slurring
obscenities. “You worthless piece of shit! Think you can hide from me?” A
younger version of the thief, a boy no more than twelve, cowering in the
corner, skinny arms raised to protect his head. The sting of a belt buckle
across his cheek. The searing pain. The shame. The impotent, burning hatred.
The gnawing emptiness in his stomach that was a constant companion. Another
voice, a woman’s, shrill and broken, pleading, then dissolving into sobs. The
image of a cockroach scuttling across a filth-stained mattress. The
overwhelming feeling of being trapped, of being nothing, of deserving nothing
but pain.  Vale flinched, almost stumbling, releasing the button instinctively.
The raw, unfiltered misery of the young man’s existence was a corrosive acid.
He felt a pang of something akin to pity, quickly suppressed. This wasn’t
about pity. This was about… intervention. Control.  The young man, who had
been mere inches from the woman’s bag, froze. He blinked, a look of utter
bewilderment spreading across his face. His hand, which had been poised to
strike, fell limply to his side. He looked around, his predatory focus gone,
replaced by a dazed, almost childlike confusion. He glanced at the woman, then
at his own empty hand, as if wondering what he was doing, how he’d gotten
there. Then, with a shake of his head, he turned and shuffled away,
disappearing into the crowd, the intended theft forgotten, a fleeting impulse
erased by a sudden, inexplicable mental fog.  The older woman, none the wiser,
found her pass and proceeded towards the turnstiles.  Vale leaned against the
pillar, a little shaky. The intensity of the thief’s memory, its sheer
ugliness, had been jarring. But the result… undeniable. He had stopped a
crime. He had, in a way, protected someone. The rush, when it came, was
different this time – less about pure sensory immersion, more about the
intoxicating feeling of influence, of unseen manipulation. The god-complex
again, subtler, more insidious.  Later, nursing a lukewarm coffee in a soulless
chain café, he opened his journal.  Entry: 09:15 hrs. Subway Intervention.
Subject: Male, approx. 22 (Attempted Theft). Proximity: ~0.8m. Memory Type:
Childhood Trauma (Domestic Abuse/Neglect). Extremely high emotional valence.
Operator reaction: Visceral recoil. Effect on Subject: Immediate
disorientation, cessation of intended criminal activity. Subject appeared to
lose intent/focus.  Observation: Memories are not just records. They are
motivators, reactive patterns, justifications. Perhaps even distractions. The
sudden influx of a powerful, unrelated memory can derail a present course of
action. Is this ‘healing’? Unlikely. Temporary disruption? Almost
certainly. The long-term efficacy of these interventions is questionable. Does
the young man revert to his patterns once the immediate confusion fades?
Probably. But for a moment, he was… inert.  Vale chewed on the end of his
pen. He was rationalizing, he knew it. The desire for the action, for the rush
of wielding this power, was the real driver. The ethical questions were
becoming a smokescreen for the burgeoning addiction.  Further thought: The
purity of the motive is irrelevant if the outcome prevents harm. Or is it? This
is a dangerous path.  He closed the journal, the unease a cold knot in his
stomach. Despite the nightmares, despite the growing sense of his own identity
fraying at the edges, the compulsion was growing stronger. He found himself
constantly, almost unconsciously, fondling the device in his pocket, its smooth
coolness a reassuring presence. His gaze, once trained to spot threats, now
scanned crowds for the tell-tale signs of distress, for interesting
‘subjects,’ for the next hit of vicarious experience. He was a connoisseur
of sorrow, a collector of pain.  The following days blurred into a pattern of
restless wandering, brief, unsatisfying check-ins at the Agency (where he felt
Mercer’s sharp, assessing gaze on him more than once), and increasingly
frequent uses of the device. He was still expected to show up periodically,
even on paid leave, to check emails, maintain a semblance of professional
continuity. He’d sit at his stark desk in the open-plan office space reserved
for operatives between assignments, the hum of secure servers a monotonous
backdrop. Mercer would sometimes stroll by, her expression unreadable.
“Everything alright, Vale?” she’d ask, her voice deceptively casual.
“You seem… distant.”  “Just processing, Mercer. Long mission,” he’d
reply, offering a bland, non-committal response. He knew she didn’t buy it.
He’d catch her watching him when she thought he wasn’t looking, her eyes
narrowed. He often found himself just staring into space, lost in the echo of
some stranger’s stolen moment, the fluorescent lights of the office
reflecting off his vacant eyes.  He was learning more about the device’s
nuances. One afternoon, in a quiet art gallery, he targeted a woman who was
openly weeping in front of a somber, abstract sculpture. Her grief felt old,
deeply rooted. Experimentally, he held the button down longer than usual. The
memories spooled backwards, not just the recent catalyst for her tears, but
further, through years of accumulated sadness, small disappointments, old
heartaches. Then, a flicker. A brief, sun-drenched memory of laughter, a shared
picnic with a man whose face was now creased with youthful joy. A moment of
uncomplicated happiness. Vale released the button precisely then.  The
woman’s sobbing subsided. She took a shaky breath, a bewildered but
distinctly lighter expression dawning on her face. A faint, watery smile
touched her lips. She looked at the sculpture again, not with despair, but with
a kind of gentle, distant melancholy, as if the raw edge of her pain had been
smoothed, replaced by a softer, more manageable echo. She seemed… relieved.
Much happier.  Vale jotted it down later, a tremor of excitement running
through him.  Entry: Variable Memory Access. Duration of button press
correlates with depth of memory penetration. Possible to navigate to earlier,
potentially positive, memory states. Releasing device activation during such a
state appears to leave the subject with the emotional residue of that specific
memory, rather than the one that triggered the initial distress. This… this
could be a genuine tool for alleviating suffering. If managed correctly.  The
‘if managed correctly’ was the caveat that sang to his intellect,
silencing, for a moment, the alarm bells of his conscience. He began to
fantasize about refining his technique.  Entry: Optimal Intervention Strategy.
Random memory targeting is… crude. To truly ‘help,’ one would need to
understand the specific locus of the subject’s distress. A conversation,
perhaps? Subtle probing to identify the haunting memory, then targeted
extraction or overlay with a positive counterpart? Requires a different kind of
engagement. More risk of exposure, but potentially greater… efficacy.  The
thought excited him. It wasn’t just about the raw rush anymore; it was about
precision, about mastery. He was becoming an artist, a sculptor of the psychic
landscape. The ethical erosion was almost complete, replaced by a craftsman’s
pride in his burgeoning, terrible skill.  His current Moleskine was filling
rapidly. He had to start abbreviating, his handwriting becoming tighter, more
compressed, as if trying to cram the overwhelming weight of his experiences
into its finite pages. One morning, after a particularly potent session with a
despondent street musician (whose memory of a triumphant, sold-out college gig
had left the man tapping his foot and humming, his despair momentarily
forgotten), Vale pressed the button on the device, intending to review the
memory later, only to be met with a tiny, almost inaudible series of clicks.
Nothing happened.  He frowned, trying again. Clicks. Blank.  Panic, cold and
sharp, lanced through him. Had it broken? Was his supply cut off? He fumbled
with it, his heart sinking. Then he noticed it – a miniscule LED near the
recessed reset stud, blinking a faint, insistent red he’d never seen before.
He experimentally pressed a small, almost invisible eject symbol on its side, a
symbol he'd overlooked in his initial, cursory examinations. A tiny slot,
barely noticeable, popped open, revealing the edge of a micro SD card.  He
pulled it out. 128GB. And it was, presumably, full.  Relief washed over him, so
potent it left him weak-kneed. It wasn’t broken. It just needed… emptying.
Like a camera. He hurried to a nearby electronics store, his mind racing. He
bought a pack of high-capacity micro SD cards and a small, generic card reader.
Back in the relative privacy of his cramped Arlington apartment – Elise was
at work, Pookey eyed him with lingering suspicion from atop the refrigerator
– he plugged the full card into the reader and connected it to his burner
laptop.  Files. Dozens of them. Cryptically named with alphanumeric strings. He
clicked on one at random. It wouldn't open. "Unsupported file type." Of course.
Proprietary.  But the implications hit him with the force of a physical blow.
Data storage. Removable media. This wasn’t just a personal, localized effect.
These memories were being recorded. Stored. And if they were being stored in a
transferable format…  Entry: Data Storage Confirmed. Device utilizes standard
micro SD cards. Files are encrypted/proprietary format. Conclusion: These
recordings are intended for playback. Therefore, playback devices must exist.
This technology is not an isolated anomaly developed by Okafor in a vacuum and
then simply weaponized for field use.  Vale’s breath hitched. This changed
everything. He wasn’t just a lone operative who’d stumbled upon a rogue
piece of tech. He was holding a key, yes, but it was a key to a room that was
part of a much larger, previously invisible house. An ecosystem.  If there are
players, he wrote, his hand flying across the page, then there are users.
Collectors? Voyeurs? Who would want these raw, unfiltered emotional downloads?
And for what purpose? Healing, as Okafor intended? Or something far darker? The
Agency’s ‘applications’ – interrogation, asset recruitment – seemed
almost… pedestrian compared to the potential for systematic emotional
exploitation.  His mind flashed back to the vague reports Mercer had once
mentioned, whispers in the agency ether about wealthy, eccentric individuals
who paid exorbitant sums for ‘bespoke experiences,’ for sensory imprints.
He’d dismissed it at the time as black-ops rumour-mongering. Now, it felt
chillingly plausible.  He, Aaron Vale, disillusioned Agency man, nascent memory
thief, accidental psychic surgeon, might have just stumbled upon the periphery
of an entire underground community, a secret market dealing in the most
intimate commodity of all: human experience itself.  The weight of the loaded
SD card in his palm felt immense. It wasn’t just a collection of stolen
moments anymore. It was evidence. It was currency. It was a breadcrumb.  His
earlier, vague ambition to understand and control the device for his own
leverage or escape now seemed almost laughably small-minded. There was a whole
world here, lurking just beneath the surface of the everyday. And he, with his
stolen prototype and his growing, terrible hunger, was uniquely positioned to
explore it.  A new objective began to form in his mind, sharp and compelling,
pushing aside the last vestiges of his professional caution and moral
hesitation. He needed to find a player. He needed to see what these recordings
truly were when unlocked. He needed to understand the full scope of what Okafor
had wrought, and what the Agency – and perhaps others – had turned it into.
The nightmares, the risk to his sanity, the betrayal of his oath – they all
seemed to recede, dwarfed by the electrifying prospect of this new, far
grander, far more dangerous game. He carefully labeled the full SD card –
Batch 001 – and slid it into a small, fireproof pouch he kept for sensitive
items. Then he inserted a fresh card into the device, the click of it seating
home a satisfying, definitive sound.  He was no longer just a user. He was an
explorer. And the shadows were deeper and more inviting than he could ever have
imagined.
Chapter 5: The Collector's Loss
The metallic screech of the subway car braking was a discordant symphony
that grated on Reverend Wayne Marcullis’s refined sensibilities. He smoothed
the lapels of his impeccably tailored charcoal suit, a subtle moue of distaste
playing on his lips as he surveyed the carriage. The hoi polloi, as he
privately termed them. Their tired faces, their cheap clothes, the cacophony of
their existence – it was an assault. Being forced to utilize this
subterranean cattle car due to an unforeseen traffic snarl downtown was an
indignity he bore with the strained patience of a saint obliged to wade through
a pigsty.  To escape the oppressive mundanity, the sheer, unadulterated
commonness of it all, Reverend Marcullis retreated to his inner sanctum, the
carefully curated gallery of his most exquisite memories. He closed his eyes,
just for a moment, the slight sway of the car a gentle rocking. He selected a
particular treasure, one of his earliest, a foundational piece in his
collection, resonant with a primal, almost adolescent thrill. Yes. That one.
The memory bloomed, rich and vibrant, pushing aside the stale air and the
muffled announcements, transporting him.  Aaron Vale, meanwhile, was on the
hunt. His senses were sharper now, attuned not just to overt distress but to
the subtle undercurrents of concealed intensity, the tell-tale hum of a mind
operating on a different frequency. He spotted Marcullis almost immediately.
The man radiated a cool, almost reptilian self-possession, yet there was
something else beneath the expensive fabric and the air of bored superiority. A
tightly coiled energy. A darkness artfully veiled. He was… interesting.
Vale, carrying a worn satchel containing his journal and a recently purchased,
untraceable public transit card, had become adept at inconspicuous proximity.
He positioned himself a few feet away from Marcullis, leaning against a grubby
pole, affecting the tired slump of a late-shift worker. The Reverend’s eyes
were closed, a faint, almost imperceptible smile gracing his lips. He was
elsewhere. Vale’s fingers, already familiar with the smooth contours of the
device in his pocket, twitched. This man wasn’t visibly distraught, not like
the grieving mother or the briefly desperate musician. This was different. This
was a foray into uncharted territory, driven by a deeper, more insistent
curiosity about the spectrum of human experience, and, if he was honest, the
raw, addictive thrill of trespass.
He let his own gaze soften, defocusing, taking in the grimy car, the flickering
lights, the faces blurred by motion. Then, as the train lurched into a tunnel,
plunging the carriage into momentary dimness punctuated by the emergency
lights, he made his move. A slight stumble, a muttered apology, bringing his
hand, device activated, to within inches of the Reverend’s temple. He pressed
the button.  The stale, recycled air of the subway car vanished, sucked away as
if by a colossal vacuum.  The world erupted. Vale was no longer Aaron Vale; he
was Reverend Wayne Marcullis, younger, leaner, adrenaline thrumming through his
veins like a live wire. The air was cold, bitingly so, carrying the sharp,
metallic tang of an impending snowstorm and the fainter, sweeter scent of pine
from the dense woods that pressed in on all sides. Night. A sliver of moon,
sharp as a shard of glass, offered little illumination beyond the weak,
bouncing beams of the pickup truck’s headlights painting a narrow, rutted
track through the wilderness.  He was driving, hands gripping the worn steering
wheel, knuckles white. Not from tension, but from… anticipation. A delicious,
almost unbearable tightening in his chest, in his loins. Beside him, she was
whimpering. Her name was… unimportant. A vessel. Her terror was a perfume,
heady and intoxicating. He could smell it over the musty scent of the truck’s
interior – the acrid spike of her fear-sweat, the salt of her tears.
“Please… just let me go… I won’t tell anyone, I swear…” Her voice
was a pathetic, broken bleat.  He chuckled, a low, guttural sound that rumbled
in his (Vale’s/Marcullis’s) chest. The sound was rich with contempt and a
burgeoning, glorious power. He reached over, not ungently, and stroked her
hair. It was matted with dirt and something sticky he knew was her blood from
the initial… persuasion. “Hush now, little lamb,” he cooed, his voice a
silken, predatory caress. “The Shepherd looks after his flock.”  The memory
wasn’t just visual; it was a symphony of sensation. Vale felt the rough
fabric of Marcullis’s jeans against his thighs, the cold seeping through the
truck’s poorly sealed doors. He tasted the coppery tang of adrenaline on his
tongue, felt the phantom throb of Marcullis’s erection, a disgusting,
visceral response to the girl’s palpable fear. He heard the frantic,
rabbit-like thumping of her heart, somehow audible over the growl of the engine
and the relentless whine of the wind.  He pulled the truck to a stop in a
small, snow-dusted clearing. The trees stood like skeletal sentinels, their
bare branches clawing at the bruised-purple sky. He cut the engine. The sudden
silence was profound, broken only by her ragged, hiccuping sobs and the distant
sigh of the wind through the pines.  This was the moment. The precipice. The
sacred, terrible stillness before the sacrament. He turned to her, and in the
faint, ghostly light from the dashboard, he saw her face. Young. Pretty, once.
Now, a mask of terror, streaked with tears and grime. Her eyes were wide, dark
pools reflecting her impending doom. It was… beautiful. A perfect canvas of
despair.  He didn’t hurry. He savored it. Each second was a pearl, strung on
the thread of her dwindling hope. He leaned in, inhaling her fear, his own
senses preternaturally sharp. He could smell the cheap shampoo in her hair, the
faint, lingering scent of lavender fabric softener on her clothes, now overlaid
with the primal stench of approaching death.  Then, the act itself. It wasn’t
frenzied. It was… methodical. Controlled. An artist at his work. Vale
experienced the cold weight of the hunting knife in his hand, the satisfying
heft of it, the way the polished wood of the handle fit perfectly into his
palm. He felt the sickening, soft resistance as the blade bit into yielding
flesh, the warm, gushing wetness that followed. Not a splash, but a terrible,
intimate seepage. Her scream was abruptly, mercifully, cut short, a gurgling
exhalation.  There was no revulsion in Marcullis’s memory, only a profound,
almost spiritual sense of release. A catharsis. A rightness. As if a discordant
note in the universe had been silenced, an imperfection erased. He felt
powerful. God-like. The blood on his hands wasn't a stain; it was a baptism. He
was purifying the world, one insignificant life at a time. This was his
purpose. His secret, sacred ministry.  The memory lingered on the aftermath:
the surprisingly mundane task of cleaning the blade on a clump of snow-dusted
grass, the physical exertion of dragging her slight form deeper into the woods,
the cold earth yielding beneath his shovel. And through it all, that lingering,
triumphant hum of satisfaction. A job well done. A masterpiece completed. A
favored, cherished addition to his collection.  Vale ripped himself free,
releasing the button with a convulsive jerk. He stumbled back, his hand flying
to his mouth to stifle a cry, his body slick with a cold sweat that had nothing
to do with the overheated subway car. He was back. He was Aaron Vale. But the
lingering stench of pine and blood, the phantom sensation of the knife in his
hand, the echo of that monstrous, joyful calm – they clung to him like grave
dirt.  He gagged, his stomach roiling. The world tilted, the faces of the other
passengers wavering, unreal. He felt… contaminated. Violated in a way that
made the shared grief of Mrs. Albright seem almost benign. He had not just
witnessed a murder; he had been the murderer, inhabited his thoughts, shared
his sickening gratification.  On the other side of the aisle, Reverend Wayne
Marcullis jerked as if jolted by an electric current. His eyes snapped open,
wide and unfocused. The beatific, private smile was gone, replaced by a look of
profound, animalistic confusion. He clutched his head, his perfectly styled
silver hair disarrayed.  “No…” he whispered, his voice hoarse,
incredulous. “Where… where did it go?”  His face, moments before a mask
of serene self-satisfaction, was now a canvas of rapidly dawning horror, then
disbelief, then a raw, burgeoning fury. He wasn’t looking at Vale, wasn’t
aware of him or anyone else. His gaze was turned inward, searching desperately
for something precious, something integral, that was suddenly, inexplicably…
missing.  It was the joy of it. The specific, exquisite flavor of that
particular memory, the nuanced texture of that triumph – it had been
surgically excised. The facts might still be there, hazy and disconnected, but
the emotional core, the very essence of what had made it a favorite, had
vanished, leaving a raw, gaping void in its place. It was like a phantom limb,
but of the soul. He could feel the shape of its absence, a cold, hollow ache
where something vital had been.  Marcullis, The Shepherd, let out a low,
guttural sound, a sound of pure, wounded rage. His eyes, now flinty and sharp,
began to scan the subway car, no longer with disdain, but with a new, predatory
intensity. Someone… something… had intruded. Had taken from him. Violated
his most sacred, private space. The indignity of it was a burning fire.  His
obsession, a cold, meticulously cultivated plant, had just found fertile,
poisoned soil in which to blossom into a monstrous bloom. He would find who did
this. He would understand how. And he would exact a terrible, biblical
retribution. The Shepherd did not suffer his treasures to be plundered.  Vale,
meanwhile, was struggling to maintain his composure. He felt psychically grimy,
as if coated in the filth of Marcullis’s soul. He needed to get off this
train, needed air, needed to scrub the experience from his mind, an impossible
task. He stumbled towards the doors just as they hissed open at the next
station.  As he half-fell onto the platform, the noise and bustle of the
station a welcome, grounding cacophony, his mind was racing, trying to process
the enormity of what he’d just experienced and unleashed. This wasn’t just
some twisted individual; the man radiated an aura of power, of untouchability.
A high-ranking religious leader? It was almost too grotesque to comprehend.  He
leaned against a tiled wall, breathing deeply, trying to push away the phantom
sensations. His journal felt heavy in his satchel. What could he even write?
Subject: Apparent pillar of community. Memory Type: Serial Murder
(Predatory/Ritualistic). Operator Reaction: Acute psychic trauma. Nausea.
Existential dread.  And then, a memory fragment from his Agency days surfaced,
unbidden. A classified briefing he’d only partially paid attention to,
something Mercer had been peripherally involved in. Whispers about
‘experiential data markets,’ off-the-books investigations into powerful,
clandestine networks. He’d dismissed it as intra-agency paranoia, the kind of
shadowy conjecture that thrived in Langley’s cubicles.  “There are
whispers, Vale,” Mercer had said once, her voice low, almost a throwaway
comment during a debrief on an unrelated corporate espionage case. “About
certain… collectors. Individuals with peculiar appetites and bottomless
pockets. They don’t just want information; they want to feel. They pay for…
curated experiences. The more extreme, the more valuable.”  At the time,
he’d thought she meant exotic travel simulations, perhaps, or hyper-realistic
combat scenarios. He hadn’t imagined… this. The trafficking of real, stolen
memories. The commodification of joy, of grief, of terror. Of murder.  Could
this Reverend Marcullis, this Shepherd, be one of them? Not just a creator of
such dark "content," but a consumer as well? Or perhaps he was both, a
connoisseur and a contributor to some unseen, unholy library.  The device in
Vale’s pocket suddenly felt less like a tool of liberation or even of mere
trespass, and more like a cursed artifact, a key to a very dark, very real
underworld. He had wanted to understand its potential, to explore its limits.
He was beginning to realize he had waded into waters far deeper and more
shark-infested than he could have ever conceived.  The weight of the stolen
memories – Pookey’s primal hunt, Mrs. Albright’s raw grief, the petty
thief’s bleak despair, and now, this clergyman’s ecstatic brutality – was
becoming a crushing burden. But beneath the horror, beneath the fear and the
self-disgust, a new, cold resolve was forming. He had seen the monster’s
face, had tasted its joys. He couldn’t unsee it. And The Shepherd, he knew
with a chilling certainty, would now be hunting him, the anonymous thief who
had stolen a piece of his rotten soul. The game hadn’t just changed; it had
escalated to a lethal new level.
Chapter 6: The Handler's Warning
The ghost of Reverend Marcullis’s blood-soaked ecstasy clung to Vale
like a disease. Sleep offered no sanctuary, only a kaleidoscopic replay of
pine-scented darkness, the glint of a knife, and a chilling, triumphant
laughter that echoed with his own voice. He’d wake in a cold sweat, the
phantom weight of the clergyman’s depraved satisfaction a sickening presence
in his own mind, forcing him to stumble to the bathroom, gagging, trying to
scour the metaphysical filth from his soul with scalding water and harsh soap.
It didn’t work. Some stains, he was learning, were indelible.  His paranoia,
once a low hum of professional caution, had escalated into a screeching siren.
Every unexplained noise in the apartment building, every lingering glance from
a stranger on the street, every flicker of static on his burner phone felt like
a sign, a portent. He’d taken to sweeping their small Arlington flat for
bugs, a meticulous, almost ritualistic process that yielded nothing but dust
bunnies and Elise’s bewildered questions, which he’d brush off with vague
mentions of “Agency drills” or “staying sharp.” His journal entries
became more cryptic, a shorthand of impressions and coded warnings to himself,
the fear of discovery a palpable presence as he wrote. The Moleskine, once a
tool for understanding, now felt like a potential indictment, a map of his own
damnation.  He still carried the memory device, its familiar coolness in his
pocket a perverse comfort, a dark promise of escape he now resisted with the
desperation of a drowning man fighting the undertow. He hadn’t used it since
Marcullis. The raw, unfiltered horror of that experience had been a brutal but
effective deterrent, for now. But the craving, the deep, gnawing hunger for
that god-like immersion, still whispered to him in the quiet hours, a siren
song promising oblivion from the cacophony in his own head.  It was during one
of his mandated “check-ins” at the Langley annex, a sterile purgatory of
grey cubicles and bad coffee, that Mercer finally made her move. He was staring
blankly at a flagged intelligence digest on his terminal, the words blurring
into meaningless symbols, when her shadow fell across his screen.  “Vale. My
office. Now.”  Her tone was flat, devoid of its usual carefully calibrated
professional warmth. It was the voice she used for delivering bad news or
dressing down a subordinate. Vale’s stomach tightened. He rose, his movements
betraying none of the internal turmoil, and followed her to the small,
windowless room she laughably called an office.  She didn’t invite him to
sit. She remained standing behind her utilitarian metal desk, her arms crossed,
her gaze sharp and unyielding. The room felt small, suffocating.  “Close the
door,” she said.  Vale complied, the click of the latch echoing with an
uncomfortable finality.  “Alright, Aaron,” she began, using his first name,
a tactic that could signal either camaraderie or a prelude to evisceration.
Today, it felt like the latter. “Let’s cut the crap. You’ve been… off.
Ever since the Stargate op. More than off. You’re distracted, unfocused. You
look like hell. And your after-action report on West Creek was… thin. Vague.
More like a placeholder than a professional assessment.”  Vale kept his
expression neutral, his training kicking in. “It was a difficult extraction,
Mercer. Unexpected variables.” The old, worn-out excuse.  Her lips thinned.
“Unexpected variables,” she repeated, the words dripping with sarcasm.
“Like a direct ‘terminate on confirmation’ order for a research scientist
being downgraded to a ‘live extraction’ based on your theatrical warning
shots and a sudden, convenient surrender?”  Vale felt a prickle of cold sweat
at the base of his neck. She knew. Or at least, she suspected, far more deeply
than he’d allowed himself to believe. “The target surrendered, Mercer. My
assessment at the time was that she no longer posed an immediate threat and
could be a valuable asset for debriefing. Protocol allows for situational
judgment.”  “Protocol also dictates following a direct, lawful order, Vale.
Especially when it comes from your handler during a black op. ‘Terminate on
confirmation,’ if memory serves. You confirmed. You did not terminate.” She
leaned forward slightly, her eyes like chips of obsidian. “People are asking
questions, Aaron. Questions I have to answer. Questions about your… judgment.
About your reliability. Questions about how a ‘bureaucratic error’ of
assigning an operative with prior non-operational contact with the target
managed to go through all checks and balances without a flag.”  He could feel
the trap closing. She wasn’t just questioning his actions during the raid;
she was questioning the entire premise of his assignment. Had she been the one
to orchestrate that ‘error’? Was this some elaborate loyalty test he’d
spectacularly failed? Or was she covering her own tracks, setting him up to
take the fall if the Stargate mess ever truly blew open?  “As I stated in my
report, Doctor Okafor collapsed. My assessment was that she was neutralized,”
he said, his voice carefully devoid of inflection. The lie felt thin, papery.
“‘Neutralized,’” Mercer scoffed, a humorless smile touching her lips.
“That’s a good word, Vale. Conveniently ambiguous. And what about the
facility itself? Operation Stargate. You spent nearly three years there on
guard duty. Plenty of time to observe, to overhear things. You got to know the
layout, the personnel. Maybe you got to know more than just the layout.”  Her
gaze was a scalpel, trying to dissect him. “There are concerns, Aaron, at
very high levels, that you might have… gleaned more insight into the core
Stargate research than your security clearance, or your subsequent SAC role,
warranted. That your previous proximity might have given you an… unhealthy
curiosity.”  Vale met her gaze, forcing a look of mild, professional
surprise. “My duties at Stargate were strictly perimeter and internal
security, Mercer. I was not privy to the specifics of Dr. Okafor’s research,
beyond the publicly available, unclassified project outlines regarding memory
and PTSD treatment. My loyalty is to this Agency.”  “Is it?” she
countered, her voice dropping to a near whisper. “Because some might say your
loyalty seems to have been… compromised. Perhaps by a misguided sense of
affinity for a target? Or perhaps by something else entirely. Something you
might have found in that lab, something that wasn’t on the official inventory
list?”  The blood roared in Vale’s ears. The device. Did she know? How
could she know? Had his team said something? No, Reyes, Martinez, Chen – they
were loyal to him, or at least to the chain of command he represented in the
field. Unless Mercer had ways of prying things out of them he didn't
anticipate. Or was this a shot in the dark, a calculated probe to see if he’d
flinch?  He held her gaze, battling the urge to let his eyes dart to the pocket
where the device rested. “We secured all relevant project materials as per
mission parameters, Mercer. One prototype data module and a drive array. It’s
all in the manifest.” Another lie, smoother this time, practiced.  She
studied him for a long, uncomfortable moment, her expression unreadable. Then,
she sighed, a sound like air leaking from a punctured tire. She uncrossed her
arms and walked around her desk, perching on its edge, adopting a more
conciliatory, almost confiding posture. The shift in her demeanor was more
unnerving than her direct assault.  “Look, Aaron,” she said, her voice
softer now, laced with a manufactured concern that set his teeth on edge.
“I’m going to be straight with you, off the record. Because, despite your
recent… eccentricities… you’ve been a good operative. A damn good one.
And I’d hate to see you throw it all away.”  She paused, as if waiting for
him to respond. He remained silent, wary.  “This Stargate technology,” she
continued, her eyes fixed on his, “this memory project Okafor was running…
it’s not just some esoteric academic pursuit. It’s a game-changer. And not
just for us. There’s… significant interest. From outside parties.”  Vale
felt his internal alarms sharpen. This was new. This wasn’t about his
disobedience or his past. This was something else.  “What kind of parties?”
he asked, keeping his tone carefully neutral, merely an operative seeking
clarification.  Mercer gave a wry, almost bitter smile. “The usual suspects,
and then some. Rival agencies, naturally. Foreign powers, of course. They’ve
been sniffing around the periphery of neuro-tech for years. But this… this is
different. More direct. More… potent. And then there are the non-state
actors. Extremist groups who see the potential for mass radicalization, for
implanting ideologies. Imagine being able to overwrite someone’s core
beliefs, Aaron. To turn a moderate into a zealot with a targeted mnemonic
payload.”  Her words sent a chill down his spine. He’d thought of the
device as a tool for extraction, for experiencing. The idea of it being used
for implantation, for direct mental manipulation on that scale, was terrifying.
Okafor’s dream of healing seemed a distant, naive fantasy in the face of such
possibilities.  “And then,” Mercer continued, her voice dropping again,
conspiratorially, “there are the private collectors.”  Vale’s heart gave
a lurch. Collectors. The word resonated with the horror of the Shepherd
encounter, with his own recent, dawning realization.  “Wealthy, powerful
individuals,” Mercer elaborated, watching him closely. “People with…
unusual tastes. People who aren’t interested in national security or
political leverage. They want the experience. The raw data. They pay fortunes
for authentic, high-fidelity sensory recordings. Joy, terror, grief, ecstasy…
the more extreme, the more valuable. There’s a black market out there, Aaron,
for human experience itself. And Okafor’s tech? It’s the Holy Grail for
these ghouls.”  She paused, letting her words sink in. Was she warning him?
Or was she fishing, trying to gauge his reaction, to see if he knew more than
he was letting on? The intensity of her gaze suggested the latter. She was
laying out bait, and he was the target fish.  “This is intel the Agency is
tracking?” Vale asked, careful to sound like a dutiful operative, absorbing
new information.  “We’re more than tracking it,” Mercer said, her voice
hardening slightly. “We’re trying to get ahead of it. Trying to control it.
Because if this technology proliferates, if it falls into the wrong hands –
and believe me, there are many, many wrong hands reaching for it – the
consequences could be… apocalyptic. Mass delusion, societal breakdown, a
world where no one can trust their own memories. It makes a dirty bomb look
like a firecracker.”  She pushed herself off the desk, her brief moment of
feigned camaraderie over. “My point, Vale, is that this is bigger than you.
It’s bigger than Stargate, bigger than one disobedient operative and a dead
scientist who should have stayed dead.” Her eyes narrowed. “If you know
something you’re not telling me, if you saw something, took something from
that lab that wasn’t on the official manifest… now would be the time to lay
your cards on the table. For your own sake. Because the people who are
interested in this technology, they don’t play by Agency rules. And they
don’t take kindly to loose ends.”  The threat, though veiled, was
unmistakable. She wasn’t just worried about his loyalty to the Agency; she
was warning him about external dangers, dangers she perhaps felt he was
ill-equipped to handle, or worse, that he might already be entangled with.
Vale felt a profound weariness settle over him. He was walking a razor’s
edge, with Mercer and the Agency on one side, and God-knows-what shadowy forces
on the other. His secret, the stolen device, was no longer just leverage or a
tool for personal exploration; it was a beacon, attracting predators he
couldn’t yet see.  “I’ve told you what happened in that lab, Mercer,”
he said, his voice low and steady. “My report stands.” It was a gamble, a
defiant stand on crumbling ground.  Mercer stared at him for a long moment, her
expression a mixture of frustration, suspicion, and something that might have
been a flicker of genuine, if reluctant, concern.  “Alright, Vale,” she
said finally, her voice clipped. “Have it your way. But don’t say I
didn’t warn you. You’re on thin ice. And it’s cracking beneath your feet.
You’re dismissed.”  He nodded curtly and left her office, the weight of her
unspoken accusations, her veiled threats, and her disturbing revelations
pressing down on him. As he walked through the sterile corridors of Langley, he
felt more isolated, more hunted, than ever before. His paranoia was no longer
just a feeling; it was a rational response to an increasingly dangerous
reality.  He had to be more careful. He had to hide the device, his journal,
his every illicit thought and action, not just from the Agency, but from these
new, unknown players Mercer had alluded to. The game had changed again. And he
was rapidly running out of places to hide, both in the external world and
within the fracturing confines of his own mind.  That evening, back in the
deceptive safety of his apartment, he didn’t write in his journal. Instead,
he carefully pried up a loose floorboard beneath his side of the bed, a hiding
spot he’d prepared years ago for a different kind of contingency. He wrapped
the Moleskine and the small pouch containing the memory cards in an oilcloth,
then nestled them into the shallow space, replacing the board so seamlessly
even Elise would never notice.  The device itself remained in his pocket. A
dangerous companion. An undeniable addiction. A terrible, irresistible key. He
was in too deep to turn back now, even if he wanted to. And a part of him, the
darkest part, didn’t want to at all. He needed to know more. He needed to
understand who these collectors were, how this black market operated. And he
had a chilling suspicion that Reverend Wayne Marcullis, The Shepherd, might be
his first, unwilling guide into that abyss.
Chapter 7: The Fractured Vow
The encounter with Mercer had left Vale feeling stripped raw, exposed. Her
warnings about collectors and extremist groups, her thinly veiled threats, had
dialed his paranoia to an almost unbearable pitch. He saw Agency surveillance
in the flicker of a streetlamp, in the way a car seemed to linger too long at
the curb. His apartment, once a neutral space, now felt like a poorly secured
safe house, each creak of the floorboards a potential intrusion.  His
relationship with Elise, always a companionship of convenience, a buffer
against loneliness rather than a true meeting of souls, had become yet another
source of anxiety. Her uncomplicated optimism, her steadfast belief in the
Agency’s inherent goodness, now grated on him, a stark, painful reminder of
the chasm between her world and the shadowy reality he inhabited. He found
himself withdrawing further, his responses to her cheerful chatter
monosyllabic, his presence in their shared space increasingly spectral.  The
stolen device, despite the horrors it had shown him, remained a potent, almost
magnetic presence in his pocket. He hadn’t used it on a stranger since
Marcullis, the psychic contamination too vile, too fresh. But the need for it,
the baseline hum of addiction, was a constant thrum beneath the surface of his
thoughts. He was fighting it, but it was an exhausting, relentless battle.  The
discovery, when it came, was almost insultingly mundane.  He’d come home
early from one of his pointless Langley check-ins, the weight of Mercer’s
suspicion a heavy cloak on his shoulders. Elise wasn’t due back from her
receptionist post at CIA headquarters for another hour. He was restless, the
silence of the apartment amplifying the turmoil in his head. He decided to do a
load of laundry, a mindless, domestic task to anchor himself.  As he was
sorting through the hamper, separating his grimly functional darks from
Elise’s more flamboyant collection of floral prints and brightly colored
blouses, a small, unfamiliar object fell from the pocket of one of her silk
camisoles. A single earring. Not one he recognized. It was a small, elegant
silver knot, tastefully understated, and definitively not something from her
usual, more whimsical collection of costume jewelry.  A knot of a different
kind tightened in Vale’s stomach. It was nothing, he told himself. A stray.
Something she’d found, perhaps, or borrowed and forgotten to return. But the
explanation felt hollow, a weak defense against a sudden, ugly suspicion.  He
picked it up. The silver was cool against his palm. He turned it over,
examining the clasp. It was well-made. Expensive. Not something one would
acquire casually.  Later that evening, Elise was in the bathroom, humming along
to some pop song on the radio, the sound of running water a backdrop to her
off-key melody. Vale, feigning an interest in a news program, felt the weight
of the silver earring in his pocket. His mind, already primed for suspicion by
Mercer’s machinations and the inherent paranoia of his profession, began to
connect invisible dots. Elise had been… different lately. More distracted,
perhaps. Her cheerfulness a little too bright, a little too brittle. There had
been a few late nights, excused by “drinks with the girls from reception”
or “a backlog of filing.” Excuses he’d accepted without question, too
preoccupied with his own demons.  He knew it was a violation. A profound one.
But the insidious logic of the device, the promise of knowing, was a powerful
seduction. This wasn’t about the rush of vicarious experience; this was about
truth. His truth. Or so he told himself. The line between righteous
investigation and obsessive trespass had long since blurred into nonexistence.
He waited until she was asleep, her breathing soft and even beside him. The
room was dark, the only light the faint, bluish glow from the digital alarm
clock. He slid the memory device from its hiding place beneath the loose
floorboard. His heart hammered against his ribs, a frantic, guilty rhythm. He
felt like a common thief, which, in a way, he was.  He leaned over her, his
movements slow, deliberate. Her blonde hair fanned out on the pillow, her face
relaxed in sleep, innocent. He positioned the device, its cool, smooth surface
inches from her temple. He hesitated. This was Elise. The woman who, for all
their emotional distance, shared his bed, his home, his life, however
superficial that life might be. To do this to her…  But the suspicion, fueled
by the earring and his own pervasive paranoia, was a corrosive acid. He needed
to know.  He pressed the button.  The sterile darkness of their bedroom
dissolved, replaced by the warm, amber glow of a dimly lit bar. Not one he
recognized. Soft jazz played, a muted trumpet weaving a melancholy tune. Vale
was Elise. He felt the slight tightness of the silk camisole against his skin,
the comfortable weight of her body in a plush leather booth. Across the small,
candlelit table, a man was smiling at her.  He was handsome, in a bland,
predictable way – crisp white shirt, expensive watch, an easy, confident
smile that didn’t quite reach his eyes. Vale/Elise felt a flutter of…
something. Excitement? Nerves? The clink of ice in a cocktail glass. Her own
laughter, a little too loud, a little too bright.  “Another one, Elise?”
the man’s voice, smooth as single malt. His name was… Mark. Or Matt.
Something with an M. Head of some tedious internal audit department at the
Agency.  “Why not?” Her voice, Vale/Elise heard, was flirtatious, a playful
lilt he hadn’t heard from her in months, if ever. She felt a warm flush creep
up her neck. The conversation was light, inconsequential – office gossip,
complaints about bureaucracy, the shared ennui of mid-level government
employment.  Then the scene shifted. The bar was gone. Now it was the sterile,
impersonal interior of a hotel room. Standard corporate décor. King-sized bed,
neatly turned down. The city lights glittered through the window, distant and
indifferent.  Mark/Matt was there, his tie loosened, his smile more overtly
suggestive. Vale/Elise felt a wave of… resignation? A sense of inevitability.
The memory wasn’t passionate, not overtly. It was… transactional. A clumsy
fumbling with buttons and zippers. The awkward choreography of bodies seeking a
fleeting, uncomplicated connection. There was no deep emotional resonance, no
grand betrayal in the romantic sense. It was… a diversion. An escape from the
tedium of her routine, perhaps from the quiet, brooding presence of the man she
shared her apartment with.  Vale felt a dull ache, not of jealousy, not
exactly, but of… something colder. A profound sense of disillusionment. Their
arrangement, their “silent treaty against loneliness,” had been
unilaterally amended. The implicit vows, however unspoken, had been fractured.
He experienced the brief, almost perfunctory intimacy, the brush of unfamiliar
skin, the scent of a different cologne. Then, the quiet, awkward aftermath.
Mark/Matt already scrolling through his phone, detached. Elise/Vale feeling a
faint, hollow sense of… nothing much. A fleeting distraction, already fading.
Vale released the button, his hand trembling. He was back in their bedroom,
the silence pressing in. Elise murmured in her sleep, oblivious. He stared at
her, his face a mask of conflicting emotions. Anger, yes, a cold, sharp anger
at the deception, however minor its emotional weight in the grand scheme of her
life. But also… a strange, detached pity. She looked small, almost pathetic
in her unknowing betrayal.  And then the insidious thought, born of the
device’s terrible power: She’d be better off without it.  The
rationalization came swiftly, easily. This memory, this tawdry, insignificant
affair – it served no purpose but to create potential future guilt for her,
future complications for him. Their relationship, already a fragile construct,
didn’t need this extra fracture. He could erase it. He could smooth over this
small, ugly crack in their foundation. It would be… a kindness. A
prophylactic measure.  The ethics of it barely registered. He was so far beyond
that particular moral compass point now. He was a god, reshaping reality, one
memory at a time. His own, twisted justification: if the memory caused pain or
inconvenience, why not simply excise it? He was becoming a surgeon of the soul,
excising not just sorrow, but now, transgression.  He leaned over Elise again,
his resolve hardening. He positioned the device. This time, he didn’t just
press the button. He held it, navigating backwards through her recent memories,
searching for the tendrils of the affair, the planning, the anticipation. He
found them – fleeting thoughts, a hurried text message exchange, the initial,
nervous agreement for drinks. He focused on the core of the infidelity itself,
the hotel room, the hollow act. He pictured it being… unwound, unspooled,
deleted from her mental archive.  He wasn't sure how it worked, this targeted
erasure. Was he truly deleting it, or merely burying it so deep it would never
surface? Okafor’s research had hinted at synaptic pathways being rerouted,
softened. Perhaps that was it. He held the button until he felt a subtle shift,
a sense of… completion. Like closing a file on a computer.  He released the
button. Elise sighed softly in her sleep, a little frown creasing her brow for
a moment, then smoothing out.  Vale sat back, a strange hollowness echoing
within him. He had done it. He had altered her mind, stolen a piece of her
reality, however unsavory that piece might have been. He felt no triumph, only
a cold, unsettling sense of power abused.  The next morning, Elise was…
different. Subtly so. The slight tension he’d begun to notice around her eyes
was gone. Her cheerfulness seemed less forced, more genuine. She made him
breakfast – burnt toast, as usual – but she hummed, her earlier lightness
restored. There was no awkwardness, no hint of guilt or unease in her demeanor.
The memory of Mark/Matt and the hotel room was, to all appearances, gone.
Their interactions felt… smoother. The slight edge of her recent distraction
had vanished. Superficially, their relationship seemed to have improved. But
Vale knew the truth. It was a peace built on an erasure, a comfort born of
violation. The hollowness he felt was the price of that manufactured
tranquility. He had stolen something fundamental from her, not just a memory,
but her agency, her right to her own past, however imperfect.  He struggled
with it, in the quiet moments. He replayed the justifications in his mind: it
was an insignificant affair; she was better off without the guilt; their
arrangement was one of convenience anyway. But the arguments felt thin,
self-serving. He had wielded his terrible power not to heal, not even to gain
leverage, but to sanitize his own domestic landscape, to avoid an uncomfortable
conversation, to exert a god-like, unearned control.  The worst part was the
insidious way the stolen memories were beginning to seep into his own emotional
responses. He found himself reacting to Elise with a faint, lingering echo of
the sadness he’d taken from the grieving mother, a flicker of the raw despair
of the petty thief. When Elise touched him, he sometimes felt the phantom
sensation of the Marcullis victim’s terror, a chilling, inappropriate recoil
he had to consciously suppress. His own emotional landscape was becoming a
contaminated collage, bits and pieces of other people’s lives, other
people’s pain and pleasure, inappropriately pasted onto his own.  He caught
himself looking at Elise sometimes with the cold, appraising gaze he’d
borrowed from The Shepherd, seeing her not as a partner, however flawed, but
as… a subject. An object to be managed, controlled, her inner world a
landscape he could prune and edit at will.  The weight of his actions, the
moral compromises, the fracturing of his own identity – it was a terrible,
lonely burden. He had started down this path with a desperate act of mercy for
Okafor, a desire for leverage, an escape from the Agency. Now, he was something
else entirely. A collector, yes. But also, a manipulator. A violator. And the
lines between Aaron Vale and the ghosts he carried were becoming increasingly,
terrifyingly, blurred. His fractured vows were not just to the Agency, but to
the very idea of consent, of respecting the sanctity of another’s mind. And
he was failing on all counts.
Chapter 8: The Echo of Despair
The act of editing Elise’s memory had left a peculiar residue in Vale.
The superficial improvement in their domestic atmosphere – her easier smiles,
the absence of that subtle, unspoken tension – was a constant, disquieting
reminder of his transgression. It wasn’t the potent, visceral contamination
of Marcullis’s depravity, nor the sorrowful weight of Mrs. Albright’s
grief. This was a thinner, colder sensation: the sterile satisfaction of a
problem managed, a loose variable controlled. It was the quiet hum of power
successfully, if abhorrently, applied.  Yet, interwoven with this cold sense of
control was an increasing sense of disarray within his own mind. The emotional
patterns he’d absorbed from his ‘subjects’ were becoming more intrusive,
less like echoes and more like unwelcome squatters in his psyche. He’d catch
himself responding to Elise’s mundane questions with a flash of the petty
thief’s defensive resentment, or feeling a surge of Mrs. Albright’s
soul-deep weariness when contemplating the simple act of getting out of bed.
The memory of his sister, Sarah, once a contained, mournful ache, now
frequently surfaced intertwined with Jamie Albright’s face, the details
blurring, the griefs merging into a disorienting, shared sorrow. He was a
collage of stolen feelings, his own emotional baseline increasingly difficult
to locate.  His journal entries, hidden beneath the floorboard, became more
erratic, his handwriting sometimes clear and analytical, other times cramped
and agitated. He was trying to chart his internal landscape, but the map kept
shifting, the landmarks dissolving.  Operator integrity… compromised? No.
Enhanced. Broader spectrum of empathic response. (LIE. CONTROL IS FRAYING.)
Boundaries blurring. Is this my anger, or his? Her grief, or Sarah’s? Need…
clarity. Need to see the effects. The positive outcomes.  This last thought, a
desperate attempt to validate his actions, began to take root. He hadn’t just
taken memories; he had intervened. He had, in his own twisted way, offered
relief. He’d seen it, hadn’t he? The grieving mother, Mrs. Albright,
walking away from the park with a lighter step, her crushing sorrow seemingly
blunted. The street musician, momentarily freed from his despair. Even the
young thief, his criminal intent derailed. Surely, there was good in that. A
dark good, perhaps, a morally ambiguous good, but good nonetheless.  He needed
to see it again. He needed to reinforce the narrative that he wasn’t just an
addict, a violator, but a facilitator of… peace. Of a sort.  It was Mrs.
Albright who drew him back. Her grief had been the most profound, the most
untainted by malice. He’d taken her worst agony. He imagined her now, perhaps
finding a fragile new equilibrium, the sharpest edges of her loss softened
enough for life to creep back in. He pictured her revisiting the park, not with
crushing sorrow, but with a gentle, wistful memory of her son, Jamie. He needed
to witness this "healing."  He didn’t know her full name, only “Mrs.
Albright” from the fleeting mention in the stolen memory, and the name
“Jamie.” It wasn’t much to go on. He wouldn’t approach her directly, of
course. That was too risky, too… messy. But he found himself drawn back to
the park, to the bench opposite the faded children’s playground. He went on a
Tuesday, the same day of the week he’d first encountered her, a superstitious
adherence to a pattern only he perceived.  The park was much the same: joggers,
dog-walkers, the distant shouts of children. Her bench was empty. He sat on his
own, a feigned casualness cloaking his searching gaze. Hours passed. The sun
arced across the sky. She didn't appear. He felt a pang of disappointment,
quickly morphing into a self-serving justification: she was probably out living
her life, too busy enjoying her newfound peace to linger in places of past
sorrow. Yes, that must be it.  He tried again a few days later, then the
following week. Nothing.  A seed of unease began to sprout. Had he
misremembered the name? Unlikely. The device’s recall was perfect. He decided
on a different approach. A local library, access to digitized newspaper
archives. It felt grubby, like snooping, but he rationalized it as follow-up
research, a necessary part of understanding the “treatment’s” efficacy.
He searched for “Albright” and “Jamie” in the local obituaries,
initially for the boy, to get a timeline, a confirmation of details. He found
it easily enough. James “Jamie” Albright, aged seven, deceased two months
prior after a brief, aggressive illness. The funeral notice listed his mother,
Helen Albright. Helen.  Then, his blood running cold, he widened the search
parameters for “Helen Albright.”  There it was. An obituary notice, stark
and brief, dated three weeks after he had encountered her in the park. Helen
Albright, 42, passed away at her home. Survived by… no one of immediate
relation mentioned. A private service was held.
Vale stared at the screen, the library’s quiet hum fading to a roaring
silence in his ears. Passed away at her home. It was a euphemism, he knew. It
reeked of solitude, of despair. Suicide. It had to be. Three weeks after he’d
“helped” her. After he’d stolen the core of her grief, the memory that,
however painful, had likely structured her existence, given her a focal point
for her love and her loss.  “No,” he whispered, the sound barely audible
even to himself. He clicked through local news archives, his fingers clumsy on
the keyboard. He found a small, buried article. “Woman Found Deceased in
Apparent Suicide.” No explicit mention of Helen Albright by name in the
headline, but the address, the date, the age – it matched. The report
mentioned a history of depression following the recent loss of her son.  She
was already broken. The thought slammed into his mind with the force of a
physical blow, a desperate, immediate rationalization. Her son died. She was
grieving. This… this would have happened anyway. I didn’t cause this. I
tried to help.  But the words felt like ash in his mouth. He remembered the
shift in her expression in the park after he’d used the device. The
puzzlement. The vague emptiness. Had he taken away not just her pain, but her
reason? Had her grief, as all-consuming as it was, been the tether that kept
her moored to the world, and had he, in his arrogant, ignorant meddling,
severed it?  He stumbled out of the library, the bright sunlight an affront.
The city sounds were too loud, the colors too vibrant. He felt a crushing
weight on his chest, a suffocating guilt that was far more potent, far more his
own, than any borrowed sorrow.  He’d wanted to heal, to unspool barbed-wire
memories, echoing Okafor’s idealistic words. Instead, he’d wielded a
crowbar, smashing indiscriminately at the delicate architecture of a human
soul, leaving behind a ruin. His “help” had been a profound, catastrophic
violation, not a kindness.  The internal noise, already a disorienting
cacophony of stolen emotions and his own mounting paranoia, amplified. Helen
Albright’s face, no longer just a canvas of grief, but now accusing, haunted
his waking thoughts. Her name became another ghost in the chorus, her despair
an echo that resonated deep within him.  She was already broken. Already
broken. Already… The mantra played on a loop, but it offered no solace. It
was the desperate plea of a guilty man trying to outrun his conscience.  The
line between his memories and the stolen ones became perilously thin, almost
non-existent. One morning, making coffee, he was suddenly overwhelmed by the
phantom smell of antiseptic and the cold touch of a small, still hand –
Jamie’s hand, Helen’s grief – and he dropped the coffee pot, shattering
it on the kitchen floor. Elise rushed in, her face a mask of concern.
“Aaron! What’s wrong? Are you alright?”  He stared at her, but he saw
Helen Albright’s haunted eyes. “I… I did everything I could,” he
mumbled, the words stolen from the doctor in Helen’s memory, now perversely
his own.  “Everything you could for what, sweetie?” Elise asked, her voice
gentle, confused. “It’s just a coffee pot.”  He blinked, the illusion
receding, leaving him shaky and disoriented. “Nothing. Just… tired.”
Another time, during one of his forced appearances at Langley, Mercer was
briefing a small group on a new counter-intelligence threat. As she spoke of
sleeper agents and compromised assets, Vale suddenly felt a surge of
Marcullis’s cold, predatory amusement, a sickening sense of superiority over
these oblivious fools. He almost smirked, catching himself just in time, his
heart pounding. He excused himself, claiming illness, and fled to the sterile
anonymity of a restroom, splashing cold water on his face, staring at the
stranger in the mirror whose eyes held a terrifying collection of borrowed
selves.  The memory theft wasn’t clean. It wasn’t helpful. It was a
contagion. He was a walking repository of trauma and transgression, his own
identity becoming a porous, unstable vessel. He had played God, and the price
was the slow, agonizing dissolution of Aaron Vale.  The stolen device felt like
a lump of cursed lead in his pocket. He wanted to throw it away, to hurl it
into the deepest part of the ocean. But the addiction, now intertwined with a
desperate, masochistic need to feel something, anything, other than this
suffocating guilt and the ever-present fear, was a chain he couldn’t break.
He hadn’t just stolen memories. He was beginning to realize he had stolen
lives, in ways more profound and damaging than mere physical death. And Helen
Albright’s suicide was the first, undeniable proof. The echo of her despair
was now a permanent resident in the haunted, overcrowded landscape of his mind.
Chapter 9: The Shepherd’s Method
The psychic concussion that had slammed into Reverend Wayne Marcullis
aboard that infernal subway car was unlike anything he had ever experienced. It
wasn’t pain in the conventional sense, not a physical ache or a mental
strain. It was an absence. A sudden, brutal excision from the very fabric of
his being. One moment, he had been basking in the warm, visceral glow of a
cherished memory, a particularly vibrant jewel from his collection – the
girl, the truck, the snow-kissed woods, the exquisite unfolding of her terror
culminating in that perfect, silent scream. The next, there was… nothing. A
void. A cold, sterile patch where that rich tapestry of sensation and
triumphant release had resided.  He had stumbled from the train in a daze, the
cacophony of the station an assault on his fractured senses. The world, which
moments before had been a mere backdrop to his inner theater, now pressed in
with an almost violent immediacy, yet it felt strangely… flat. As if a vital
color had been bled from his perception of reality. He made his way, almost on
autopilot, to the discreetly parked town car that was always on call, his
driver, a taciturn man named Thomas with eyes that saw little and questioned
less, opening the door with his usual impassivity.  Settled against the plush
leather, insulated from the rabble, the initial shock began to recede, replaced
by a cold, simmering fury that was far more dangerous. This wasn't a momentary
lapse, a senior moment of forgetfulness. This was a theft. A desecration.
Something had been taken from him.  Back in the hushed opulence of his private
study – a vast, book-lined chamber within the Gothic Revival edifice that
housed the global headquarters of his ‘Church of Eternal Light’ –
Reverend Marcullis began his meticulous reconstruction. The room itself was a
testament to his curated existence: centuries-old tapestries depicting scenes
of divine judgment hung alongside modern masterpieces that hinted at a darker,
more visceral aesthetic. The air smelled faintly of antique paper, beeswax, and
the expensive, single-origin coffee that steamed gently in a silver pot on his
mahogany desk. This was his sanctuary, his command center.  He sat in his
high-backed leather chair, a throne more than a seat, and closed his eyes. Not
to retrieve a memory this time, but to dissect the immediate past. He did not
panic. Panic was for the weak, the unprepared. He was The Shepherd, a vessel, a
guide. And his flock, his true flock, the Shadow that resided within him, was
disturbed. Deeply.  “Show me,” he murmured, his voice a low, resonant hum.
It was a command to himself, to his own prodigious memory, and perhaps, a
prayer, or an invocation, to the Shadow. He began with the moment of
realization on the train. The searing, empty coldness. He meticulously worked
backward, minute by agonizing minute.  The town car journey to the ill-fated
meeting downtown. The tedious, self-important drone of the city councilman
he’d been obliged to flatter. The traffic jam – an infuriating, unplanned
variable that had necessitated the humiliating descent into the public transit
system. The hurried, irritable walk to the station, the distasteful press of
bodies. And then, the subway car itself.  He conjured the scene with an almost
preternatural clarity: the flickering lights, the screech of wheels, the smell
of stale air and unwashed humanity. He visualized the faces around him,
dismissing them one by one – the harried mother with her squalling child, the
slumped figures staring blankly at their phones, the oblivious teenagers with
their intrusive music. Background noise. Irrelevant.  And then… a face swam
into focus. Not remarkable in its features. African-American. Mid-thirties,
perhaps. Dressed in nondescript, almost deliberately forgettable clothing. But
the eyes… The Shepherd paused his mental replay, a frown deepening the lines
etched around his mouth. The eyes had been… intense. Not a casual glance, not
the vacant stare of a fellow commuter. This had been a focused, penetrating
gaze, a scrutiny that, at the time, he had registered only peripherally,
dismissing it as the rude curiosity of the lower orders. Now, in retrospect,
that gaze felt different. It felt… evaluative. Predatory, almost.  He
remembered a slight jostle, a moment of closer proximity as the train had
entered a tunnel. The man had mumbled an apology. Marcullis hadn’t even
looked at him then, already retreating into the solace of his chosen
recollection. That was it. That had to be the moment of intrusion. The nexus of
the violation.  Who was he? Just a common pickpocket? No. A pickpocket stole
wallets, watches. They did not, could not, steal the very essence of a man’s
soul. This was something… new. Something unspeakably invasive.  A cold dread,
an emotion The Shepherd rarely countenanced, flickered within him, quickly
extinguished by a surge of righteous, icy fury. He rose from his chair and
paced the length of the vast Aubusson carpet, his hands clasped behind his
back. The loss was a tangible ache, a hollow where the sublime memory of the
girl in the snow had been. He could recall the facts, the sequence of events,
like reading a dry, third-person report. But the feeling, the triumphant power,
the exquisite terror that had been hers and, by extension, his – that was
gone. Erased. Leaving behind only a faint, mocking echo.  “The Shadow within
me has been robbed,” he hissed, the words a sibilant exhalation. It wasn’t
just his memory. These experiences, these… collections… they were
offerings. Sustenance. The Shadow, the ancient, knowing presence that had
chosen him, that guided his true ministry beneath the benevolent facade of the
Church of Eternal Light, feasted on such moments. It craved the intensity, the
purity of unadulterated emotion, particularly those emotions most congregations
shunned: fear, despair, the final, incandescent spark of life extinguished. To
take such a memory was not just a theft from Wayne Marcullis; it was a
sacrilege against the very entity that gave his life its dark, profound
meaning.  And the Shadow was not pleased. He could feel its cold, silent
outrage mirroring his own, amplifying it, demanding recompense. This thief,
this violator, could not be allowed to remain unpunished. He had to be found.
He had to be… understood. And then, he had to be made an example of.  The
resolve settled in him, hard and immutable as granite. He returned to his desk.
His meticulously organized mind, now laser-focused, began to strategize.
First, the visual. The man on the subway. He would need an image. He picked up
the burnished gold telephone, a direct, secure line.  “Mr. Davies,” he
said, his voice smooth, authoritative, when his chief of personal security
answered. Davies was a former military intelligence operative, fiercely loyal,
brutally efficient, and utterly unquestioning of The Shepherd’s more…
unconventional directives. “An unforeseen incident occurred today during my
unavoidable use of the public transit system. I require all available CCTV
footage from the Red Line, specifically between the Capitol South and Metro
Center stations, between… let us say, 11:40 and 12:10 hours. I am looking for
a particular individual. I will provide a description. This is of the utmost
priority.”  He described Vale with cold precision – height, approximate
build, skin tone, the forgettable clothing, and most importantly, the intensity
of the gaze. “He may have appeared to stumble or make incidental contact
around the time the train entered the tunnel nearest to Federal Triangle. Focus
on that.”  Next, the wider net. The method of the theft was still a baffling
enigma. How could a memory, an internal, subjective experience, be… stolen?
It beggared belief. Yet, it had happened. Was this some new, exotic form of
psychic attack? Or was there… technology involved? His mind, ever alert to
the whispers of the clandestine world his wealth and influence gave him access
to, recalled certain… rumors. Chatter in the more shadowy echelons of
intelligence and private security about experimental neuro-technologies.
Devices capable of interfacing with the human mind. Most of it had sounded like
science fiction, but the void within him was chillingly real.  He accessed a
different secure contact list, one reserved for individuals whose influence
extended into the murkier corridors of power. His finger hovered over a name.
Senator Harrison Blackwood, chairman of the Senate Select Committee on
Intelligence. A man whose public piety was matched only by his private
appetites, appetites The Shepherd had, on occasion, discreetly catered to,
fostering a useful, if unspoken, debt.  He dialed.  “Senator Blackwood,”
Marcullis began, his tone shifting to one of grave, concerned fellowship.
“Wayne Marcullis. I hope I’m not interrupting anything vital.”  A hearty,
slightly lubricated chuckle came down the line. “Reverend! Always a pleasure.
To what do I owe this honor?”  “Harrison, I find myself in need of some…
discreet counsel. A rather unsettling matter has come to my attention,
something that touches upon areas of your… expertise. It concerns certain
emerging technologies, neurological in nature. There are… whispers… of
devices capable of accessing, perhaps even extracting, personal experiential
data.” Marcullis chose his words with surgical care, avoiding any mention of
a personal theft, framing it instead as a broader security concern he’d
become aware of through his “pastoral work.”  “Neuro-tech?”
Blackwood’s voice sharpened, the conviviality ebbing. “That’s…
sensitive territory, Wayne. Most of that stuff is deep black, highly
compartmentalized. Why the sudden interest?”  “Let us just say, Harrison,
that certain… vulnerable members of my flock… have expressed anxieties.
There are concerns about potential misuse, about violations of personal
sanctity. I am merely trying to understand the landscape, to ascertain if such
technologies are… viable, or merely the stuff of speculative fiction.” He
paused, letting the implication hang in the air. “And, of course, to ensure
that any such developments are being managed with the utmost ethical
oversight.”  Blackwood was silent for a moment. “There are always…
rumors, Wayne. Bleeding-edge research. Some of it frankly terrifying, if even
half of it is true. But actual, field-deployable devices capable of what
you’re describing? If such a thing exists, it would be classified at levels I
rarely even get briefed on. Why are you really asking, old friend?”
Marcullis allowed a hint of carefully modulated urgency to enter his voice.
“Because, Harrison, I have reason to believe that such a device may not only
exist but may have been… deployed. Irresponsibly. Perhaps by rogue elements.
The potential for exploitation, for chaos… it’s considerable. I’m not
asking for classified schematics, merely… confirmation. A sense of whether my
concerns are founded or if I am chasing phantoms.” He added, gently,
“Naturally, any information shared would be treated with the utmost
discretion. Some things are best kept… within the fold.”  Another pause.
Then Blackwood sighed. “Alright, Wayne. No promises. But I’ll make some
quiet inquiries through… back channels. See what tremors are on the fault
lines. This kind of thing… if it’s real, it’s the kind of secret that
doesn’t stay buried forever, no matter how deep they dig the hole. Give me
twenty-four hours.”  “My gratitude, Harrison. As always.” Marcullis hung
up, a thin, satisfied smile playing on his lips. Blackwood, for all his
bluster, was a useful conduit. And fear, particularly fear of scandal or
exposure, was a powerful motivator.  The Shepherd’s mind was now a finely
tuned instrument of pursuit. Mr. Davies and his team would secure the footage.
Senator Blackwood, prodded by self-interest and a  veiled threat, would probe
the shadowed underbelly of the intelligence community. And he, The Shepherd,
would wait, and plan.  He considered the nature of the thief. Not a brute. This
required finesse, understanding. Perhaps even a certain… psychic sensitivity.
The gaze… that was the key. The intensity. As if the man had been looking
into him, not merely at him.  He swiveled in his chair to face a large, antique
map of the city that adorned one wall, its surface pricked with tiny, almost
invisible markers only he understood the significance of. His city. His hunting
ground. The thief was out there, a foreign microbe in the bloodstream of his
domain.  “The Shadow demands its due,” he whispered to the empty room.
“And The Shepherd always provides.”  His eyes, the color of polished steel,
narrowed. This wasn’t just about recovering a stolen treasure, as precious as
it was. This was about power. About control. About ensuring that no one, no
one, could breach his inner sanctum, could touch the sacred essence of his
collection, without facing a reckoning that would be both methodical and
terrifyingly absolute. The hunt had begun. And The Shepherd was a patient,
meticulous, and utterly relentless hunter. He would find this profaner of his
temple, this thief of his soul’s delight. And then, oh then, there would be a
new, very special memory to create. A memory of divine retribution.
Chapter 10: The Agency's Secrets & Okafor's Ghost
The suicide of Helen Albright had been a brutal, visceral gut punch,
stripping away the last vestiges of Vale’s self-deception about the nature of
his “interventions.” The word ‘healing’ now tasted like acid in his
mouth. He was a violator, plain and simple, a reckless meddler in the delicate,
sacred architecture of human minds, and the consequences were proving to be
catastrophic. The guilt was a living thing, a cold, heavy presence that
shadowed his every waking moment and infested his dreams with accusing faces
and silent screams.  His paranoia, already acute, intensified into a
near-constant state of siege. Mercer’s warnings, the ominous hints of private
collectors and extremist groups, echoed in his mind. He saw potential threats
everywhere – in the too-long stare of a fellow passenger on the metro, in the
unmarked vans that seemed to linger on his street, in the subtle clicks and
anomalies on his burner phone. He felt the invisible net tightening.  The
memory device, hidden beneath the floorboard along with his journal and the
growing collection of SD cards laden with stolen experiences, felt like a
radioactive isotope, silently poisoning his existence. He hadn’t touched it
since the horrifying revelation about Mrs. Albright, the compulsion to use it
temporarily overpowered by raw terror and self-loathing. But it was still
there, a dark promise, a terrible potential.  He knew he couldn't continue like
this. The fugue states, the emotional bleed-through from his victims, the
crushing guilt – it was all eroding his sanity, his ability to function. He
needed answers. He needed to understand the genesis of this cursed technology,
not just for leverage, but for his own survival, for a chance to undo some of
the damage, if such a thing were even possible. And there was only one person
who held those answers: Dr. Amara Okafor.  But Okafor was dead. Officially.
Neutralized during the West Creek raid. He’d seen her fall, heard Mercer’s
cold confirmation. Yet, the theatricality of his own actions during that raid,
his fabricated report of her surrender – it was all predicated on the hope,
the desperate gamble, that she had escaped. He’d facilitated it. He had to
believe it.  His first step was to delve into the Agency’s archives. It was a
reckless move. His access, even as a SAC operative on “administrative
leave,” was still active but undoubtedly monitored. Any unusual inquiries
into Operation Stargate would raise immediate red flags, especially after
Mercer’s pointed interrogation. But he was past caution. He was desperate.
He chose his moment carefully, late one weekday afternoon when the Langley
annex was in its pre-exodus lull. He used a communal terminal in a low-traffic
sector, relying on his old security protocols and a few subtle digital
footprints he’d learned to leave to obscure his tracks – or at least create
plausible deniability. His search terms were oblique, focusing on ancillary
Stargate project numbers, peripheral personnel, and historical funding streams
for neuroscience research that predated Okafor’s direct involvement. He was
looking for the roots, the soil from which this poisoned flower had sprung.
Slowly, painstakingly, navigating layers of classification and bureaucratic
obfuscation, he began to unearth fragments. Project names that were little more
than alphanumeric ciphers: ‘Somnus Initiative,’ ‘Project Lethe,’
‘NeuroWeaver.’ Most were dead ends, abandoned prototypes, theoretical
papers buried under mountains of redactions. But then he found a vein, a series
of heavily encrypted research proposals and internal memoranda dating back
nearly a decade, originating not from SAC or even the Directorate of Science &
Technology, but from a far more shadowy, seldom-acknowledged corner of the
Agency – the Department of Psychophysiological Research, a euphemism for what
old hands still called the “Mind Games Division.”  And there, nestled
within the technical jargon and budgetary justifications, he found her ghost.
Not just Okafor, but her intent.  The early proposals, under a different
project codename – ‘Mnemosyne Protocol’ – were strikingly different
from the Stargate he knew. The language was cautious, ethical, focused almost
entirely on therapeutic applications. He found papers co-authored by a younger,
less guarded Amara Okafor, filled with impassioned, almost poetic descriptions
of the technology’s potential.  “...to gently unspool those barbed-wire
memories…” The phrase from his own fleeting conversation with her echoed
back at him from the cold, digital text. He read about her initial vision:
aiding soldiers crippled by PTSD, offering solace to victims of catastrophic
trauma, allowing minds to process devastating experiences without being
re-traumatized. The device, in its original conception, wasn't a crowbar for
the soul, but a surgeon’s delicate tool, designed to isolate, cushion, and
re-contextualize damaging memories, fostering healing and resilience.  Vale
felt a profound, aching sorrow. This was the Okafor he remembered, the
idealistic scientist whose passion had been a rare point of light. He saw, in
the meticulously documented evolution of the project, how her original vision
had been slowly, insidiously corrupted. The funding shifted, the oversight
committees changed, the ethical review board minutes became more heavily
redacted. New ‘application parameters’ began to appear: ‘enhanced
interrogation support,’ ‘asset memory modification for plausible
deniability,’ ‘strategic cognitive influence.’ The language grew colder,
more utilitarian, the focus shifting from healing to control, from therapy to
weaponization. Stargate, as he knew it, was the monstrous, militarized
perversion of Okafor’s dream.  He understood now, with chilling clarity, why
she had looked so haunted in her lab that rainy afternoon, why she had pushed
back against the whispers of its darker applications. She had been fighting a
losing battle, her creation being twisted into something she abhorred.  And
then he found it – the anomaly.  Among the final Stargate directives, the
operational summaries leading up to the West Creek facility becoming fully
active, there was a series of encrypted internal comms logs. Most were mundane:
supply requisitions, security rota updates. But one exchange, flagged for
high-level review and then seemingly buried, caught his eye. It was dated
approximately six months before the raid. It concerned an “unforeseen
divergence in primary research personnel orientation” and discussed
“contingency protocols for asset containment and potential… cognitive
recalibration.” One name appeared repeatedly: Okafor.  The language was
chillingly bureaucratic, but the subtext was clear. Okafor had become a
problem. She was resisting. Perhaps she’d even tried to sabotage or limit the
weaponized aspects of her own research. The Agency was preparing to deal with
her. Not terminate. Contain. Recalibrate. Brainwash, essentially. Or worse.
The ‘Terminate on Confirmation’ order during the raid now took on a new,
more sinister meaning. It wasn’t just about silencing a scientist with
dangerous knowledge. It was about eliminating a rogue element, an asset who
refused to comply, whose conscience had become an operational impediment. And
Mercer’s insistence… her cool, unwavering order to kill…  A further
search, cross-referencing Okafor’s personnel file – surprisingly still
accessible, perhaps an oversight, or perhaps deliberately left as bait –
yielded another subtle clue. A series of encrypted financial transfers from an
untraceable Agency slush fund, routed through multiple shell corporations,
terminating in an account linked to a small, private airfield in rural
Maryland. The transfers were small, irregular, but consistent, and they had
ceased abruptly the day after the West Creek raid. Expense funds for an asset
being exfiltrated and kept off-book? Or hush money for someone who knew too
much?  The official reports stated Dr. Amara Okafor was deceased, body
confirmed, cremated. But Vale had learned long ago that the Agency’s official
narratives were often carefully crafted fictions. The transfers, the talk of
containment… it painted a different picture. A picture of an Agency perhaps
trying to preserve its asset, even a rebellious one, if her knowledge was
deemed too valuable to simply erase. Or perhaps, they’d failed to
‘recalibrate’ her and had simply… vanished her.  But he’d let her go.
He’d given her a head start, a chance.  The pieces began to click into place,
forming a fragile, desperate hope. If the Agency had intended to contain her,
and if his actions had disrupted that plan, then Okafor could still be alive. A
fugitive, certainly. Hunted by the very people she had once worked for. But
alive.  The thought ignited a spark in the desolate landscape of Vale’s mind.
If Okafor was alive, she was the only person who truly understood the device.
She might know how to control its side effects, how to mitigate the emotional
bleed-through that was tearing him apart. She might even know if there was a
way to reverse the damage he’d inflicted on others, a way to give Helen
Albright back the grief he’d stolen, a grief that, however terrible, might
have saved her life. It was a slim chance, a desperate Hail Mary, but it was
the only one he had.  He quickly, carefully, downloaded the relevant encrypted
files onto a heavily shielded thumb drive, wiping his terminal’s cache,
trying to cover his digital tracks as best he could. Every instinct screamed
that he was running out of time.  As he slipped out of the Langley annex, the
late afternoon sun casting long shadows, he felt a renewed sense of purpose,
however precarious. He had to find Amara Okafor. His sanity, perhaps even his
soul, depended on it.  He walked towards the metro station, his mind already
racing, formulating a plan. He’d start with the airfield in Maryland, see if
he could pick up a trail, however cold. He was an operative again, not just a
haunted shell. He had a mission.  He was so engrossed in his thoughts, in the
flickering hope of finding Okafor, that he almost missed it. A subtle shift in
the urban rhythm. The faint but unmistakable feeling of being watched.  He
didn’t turn his head. He didn’t break his stride. Years of training kept
his outward demeanor calm, casual. But his senses, already heightened by
paranoia, went on high alert. He used the reflective surface of a parked
car’s window to scan behind him.  There. Half a block back. A man.
Nondescript, like himself. Charcoal suit, impeccable, even in the wilting
afternoon heat. Silver hair, catching the light. The man wasn’t looking
directly at him, was ostensibly examining a shop window, but there was a
stillness about him, a focused intensity that Vale recognized with a jolt of
ice-cold dread.  Reverend Wayne Marcullis. The Shepherd.  He was standing
there, a patient, predatory spider in his web, his gaze, when it flickered
briefly towards Vale, holding a chilling, almost proprietary understanding. He
wasn’t just a random figure in the crowd anymore. He was actively,
deliberately, stalking him.  Vale’s blood ran cold. The secrets of the
Agency, the ghost of Okafor, the torment of his stolen memories – they all
momentarily receded in the face of this immediate, tangible threat. The
Shepherd knew. Somehow, he knew. Or at least, he had found his target.  Vale
quickened his pace, a knot of icy fear coiling in his gut. He plunged into the
throng of commuters descending into the Dupont Circle metro station, hoping to
lose himself in the anonymity of the crowd. But as he glanced back just before
the escalators carried him down into the subterranean gloom, he saw him again.
The Shepherd, standing at the top of the stairs, a dark, unmoving silhouette
against the fading light, his eyes fixed on Vale with an unwavering, chilling
resolve.  The hunt was no longer a vague paranoia. It was real. And Aaron Vale
was the prey. The first act of his descent had ended not with answers, but with
the chilling certainty that the shadows he had courted were now closing in,
embodied by a man whose darkness might rival, or even eclipse, his own.
