by Norsiwel

Prologue

The Battle of Pea Ridge, fought on March 7-8, 1862, unfolded across the rugged hills and dense forests of northwestern Arkansas, a clash that would prove decisive in the American Civil War’s Trans-Mississippi theater. Here, in a landscape of steep ravines and ancient oaks, Major General Earl Van Dorn led the Confederate Army in a bold attempt to reclaim Missouri and Arkansas from Union control. Opposing him stood Brigadier General Samuel R. Curtis, commanding the Union Army of the Southwest, determined to hold the line against the Southern advance. The battle raged over two days, with soldiers contending not only with each other but with the unforgiving terrain that shaped their every move.
     Adding a layer of complexity to this conflict was the involvement of American Indians, particularly from the Cherokee Nation. The Cherokee, led by figures like Chief John Ross and Colonel Stand Watie, found themselves entangled in the war’s web, their allegiances fractured by internal divisions and external pressures. Some Cherokee regiments fought alongside the Confederacy, hoping to secure their land and autonomy in a rapidly changing world. Yet, not all Native Americans sided with the Southmany were reluctant participants, caught between preserving their way of life and surviving the chaos that engulfed them. Tribes across the region, from the Creek to the Choctaw, faced similar dilemmas, their roles in the war a testament to the intricate ties between indigenous sovereignty and the broader struggle tearing the nation apart.  When the fighting ceased, the cost was staggering. The Union emerged victorious, but at a price approximately 1,384 soldiers lay dead, wounded, or missing. The Confederacy fared worse, with around 2,000 casualties staining the Arkansas soil. The hills of Pea Ridge, once a quiet expanse of natural beauty, now bore the scars of warsilent witnesses to a conflict that left families broken and communities uprooted.  In the wake of this bloodshed, as the echoes of cannon fire faded into the wind, the lives of those caught in its path were forever altered. Among them were Ahuli, a young Cherokee hardened by loss, and Rudy, a farm boy fleeing a shattered Confederate line. In a land fractured by war, their paths would cross, forging an unlikely bond amid the chaos. And so, our story begins.
    The sun bled orange across the water, painting the Buffalo River in fiery hues as Ahuli cast his line. He used a sturdy branch hewn from a fallen oak, its end sharpened to a point and weighted with river stones, an old Cherokee technique for angling. The cool breeze whispered through the ancient oaks lining the bank, carrying scents of pine and damp earth – a welcome respite after days spent dodging bullets on the battlefield. Memories flashed - a forced march away from his family, the rough hands of blue coated recruiters hauling him off to fight in a war he didn't understand, a life ripped apart like a bird’s wings caught in a snare. He was seventeen then, strong and capable, but not nearly as hardened by loss as he would become.
    His gaze swept across the water, observing the way the light danced on the surface. The river was teeming with life - crawfish scurrying amongst the rocks, minnows darting beneath the shade of fallen logs, all oblivious to the turmoil that gripped his home state. He felt a pang of longing for simpler times, when he'd spent days fishing alongside his father, learning the secrets of the land and how to survive off its bounty. Those memories provided an anchor in this chaotic world.
    The war had changed everything. The rolling hills of Arkansas were now stained with blood, and even the tranquil sounds of nature seemed tainted by fear. Yet, here on the riverbank, he found a fleeting sense of peace – solitude that allowed him to breathe again, to remember who he was before all this began.
    He felt confident in his surroundings - he knew these waters like the back of his hand and could read every ripple, current, and shadow with ease. He’d been living off the land since childhood, a skill honed by necessity rather than choice. His ability to find food, shelter, and safety was unmatched – a testament to years spent learning from his elders and observing the ways of nature.
    As he waited patiently for a bite, Ahuli noticed something large moving beneath the surface - an enormous catfish gliding through the depths. With practiced precision, he pulled back on the branch pole, feeling the satisfying tug of its weight against the line. The battle was forgotten as this massive creature broke the surface, thrashing wildly before finally being brought under control and hauled onto the bank.
    It was a magnificent fish - a prize worthy of celebration. He carefully cleaned it with his knife and carried it to a small cave carved into the riverbank, where he built a quick fire using dry kindling gathered from nearby brush. The aroma of roasting catfish filled the air as Ahuli sat back against the rock wall, enjoying his hard-earned meal in blissful solitude - the sounds of war fading into the background like an unwelcome dream.
    The distant rumble of cannons continued to echo across the valley, a constant reminder of the chaos unfolding at Pea Ridge. Ahuli sat by his fire, enjoying a roasted catfish as he observed the landscape with an eye for detail and caution. As dusk began to settle over the riverbank, he caught movement in the dense undergrowth - a young man crashing through the thick foliage like a wounded animal.
    The boy tumbled out onto the grass near Ahuli’s hiding spot, clutching his arm in pain as crimson blood soaked through his shirt sleeve. He looked up with wide eyes, disoriented and desperate for help. "Everybody calls me Rudy," he gasped, before collapsing back against the ground, writhing in agony.
    Ahuli watched him silently for a moment, considering the situation. A Confederate soldier fleeing from battle, wounded and seeking refuge - it was an odd encounter indeed. Yet, something about this young man’s vulnerability resonated with Ahuli's own feelings of displacement and loneliness. He had known what it was like to be on his own in a world filled with uncertainty.  The figure that crashed through the undergrowth wore the rough homespun clothes of a working farm - brown wool trousers patched at the knees, a faded blue cotton shirt now torn and bloodied, and worn leather boots caked with mud and forest debris. No gray uniform marked him as Confederate; like so many country boys pressed into service, he fought in the same clothes he'd worn behind a plow. Ahuli's eyes caught the glint of something gold at the boy's throat - a small cross on a thin chain that had somehow survived the chaos of battle.  The wounded soldier stumbled, his good hand pressed against a gaping wound in his upper arm where a Cherokee arrow protruded at an ugly angle. His face was pale beneath the grime and sweat, young features twisted in pain and confusion.
    From Rudy's perspective, the world had become a spinning nightmare of green shadows and stabbing pain. His mama's cross bounced against his chest with each desperate step, the only familiar thing left in this hellish wilderness. The gold felt warm against his skin - a final connection to the whitewashed farmhouse by the Arkansas River, to Sunday mornings in the little Baptist church, to a life that seemed impossibly distant now.    When he finally collapsed near the riverbank, gasping and clutching his wounded arm, Rudy's vision blurred. Through the haze of pain, he glimpsed a figure by a small fire - dark-skinned, long black hair, watching him with cautious eyes. For a moment, terror gripped him. Then exhaustion won out, and he let himself fall back against the cool earth, his fingers finding the cross again, holding tight to his mother's parting gift as darkness threatened to claim him.    Ahuli rose and approached the boy cautiously, extending a hand to help him sit up straight. “I have two names,” he replied calmly, as if offering an explanation for his presence there. "My name is Ahuli Ridge." He pointed towards a nearby stream of clear water running into the river, urging Rudy to drink some before continuing on with his assistance.
    Rudy winced in pain as he took advantage of the offer, drinking deeply from the cool flow and wiping sweat off his forehead with the back of his hand. The wound was severe – a Cherokee arrow embedded deep within his upper arm, its point protruding from beneath the skin. It looked like an old fashioned hunting arrowhead made by Native Americans - even more so than he thought when seeing it up close, but Ahuli knew how to remove such projectiles without causing further damage.     With steady hands and unwavering focus, Ahuli knelt down beside Rudy, carefully examining the wound with a practiced eye. "Hold still," he said gently, grabbing his knife from where it lay near the fire. He took care not to touch any blood or tissue in order to avoid infection, slowly pushing aside the boy's arm against his will but without causing him too much discomfort. The arrowhead came free easily enough once he found a good angle of leverage and pulled out with surprising efficiency - revealing an enormous amount of blood oozing from where it was taken out.     He cleaned the wound thoroughly using clean river water, applying pressure to stop the bleeding and then packing in herbs he'd collected earlier that day for their antiseptic properties. As Rudy lay there catching his breath, Ahuli wrapped up his arm tightly with a strip torn from his own shirt, securing it firmly in place. "That should do for now," he said reassuringly, standing up to survey his work with satisfaction.     Rudy looked at him gratefully, relief washing over his face as the pain began to subside slightly - but still felt significant discomfort despite the healing measures taken by Ahuli just moments ago. The two men exchanged a glance of mutual understanding and respect - both strangers brought together by circumstance, finding solace in an unexpected connection amid this turbulent time.
    The cave offered a welcome respite from the relentless sun beating down on the riverbank. Cool air circulated within its rocky walls as Ahuli tended to Rudy’s wound, changing his makeshift bandage of torn shirt fabric after several hours had passed since he'd initially helped the young Confederate soldier escape the battlefield chaos. Sunlight streamed through the cave entrance, casting long shadows across the damp stone floor and illuminating their unlikely alliance in an ethereal glow.
    Rudy lay propped against a moss-covered boulder, his face pale with exhaustion but showing signs of improvement from earlier that day when he’d crashed into Ahuli's sight after suffering such an intense wound. He stared up at the cave roof as if seeking answers to questions that remained unanswered inside him - like why exactly had this Cherokee man taken pity on a Confederate soldier?
    “How much pain are you feeling?” Ahuli inquired, his voice calm and measured. “The herbs should help with any lingering inflammation or infection.” He watched carefully for signs of discomfort in Rudy's expression as he spoke.
    Rudy grunted softly in response, shifting position slightly to ease the pressure on his arm. "It still hurts, but not as bad as before," he admitted slowly, his gaze flickering back down towards Ahuli. “You really know what you’re doing with those herbs.”
    A faint smile played at the corner of Ahuli's lips. "My people have always known how to use nature for healing,” he replied modestly. He paused momentarily, then added "Where are you from? You speak like someone from Arkansas."
    Rudy hesitated before answering, his face darkening slightly as if bracing himself for an awkward revelation. “I grew up on a farm near Little Rock," he finally said, avoiding Ahuli’s gaze. "My pa always said we were the best cotton farmers in the county.” There was an undeniable pride in his voice, but also something else - an underlying defensiveness that made it clear he wasn't ready to fully trust this stranger.
    “That sounds like good work,” Ahuli responded, trying to steer clear of any potentially sensitive topics. "I grew up hunting and fishing with my father on the Cherokee reservation," he added casually. “We were taught to respect nature and take only what we needed.” He watched Rudy’s reaction closely, searching for any sign that might reveal his true allegiance.    Rudy scoffed softly, a hint of disdain coloring his tone as he glanced at Ahuli with suspicion. "Cherokee? I've heard stories about you folks," he muttered under his breath - words loaded with prejudice and assumptions. "Always causing trouble.”
    Ahuli’s brow furrowed slightly, but he held back from reacting in anger or offense. He recognized that Rudy was speaking from ingrained prejudices – a product of the societal divisions tearing apart their land. Instead, Ahuli decided to respond calmly and rationally, hoping to bridge the gap between them by challenging those beliefs without escalating the tension further. “Those stories are just what people want you to believe,” he said firmly but respectfully. “We're not trouble-makers; we’re survivors trying to protect our way of life.” He paused, then added "Just like you, I suppose."
    Rudy’s eyes widened slightly as Ahuli spoke - perhaps the young Confederate soldier hadn’t anticipated such a measured and reasonable response from someone he had initially viewed with suspicion. A flicker of doubt crossed his face, momentarily blurring the lines between prejudice and reality.
    The tension in the cave hung thick in the air, a silent testament to the complex emotions swirling within both men - Rudy grappling with his ingrained biases while Ahuli struggled against the urge to react defensively. As they sat there in silence for a long moment, it became clear that their unlikely alliance was just beginning to form, forged amidst suspicion and uncertainty but tempered by an unspoken understanding of shared hardship and resilience.
    The silence in the cave stretched on until it felt almost palpable. Both men seemed lost in thought, grappling with their own internal conflicts and the realization of a shared predicament they were alone, separated from any semblance of order or support. The echoes of gunfire and distant shouts had faded into an eerie quietness, leaving them stranded amidst a landscape that suddenly felt vast and unforgiving.
    “It’s been a few days since I saw anyone else,” Rudy finally broke the silence, his voice laced with a nervous tremor. “I don't know where my unit went or if they even made it out alive.” He looked around at the unfamiliar surroundings, his eyes scanning for any sign of civilization that might offer some comfort.
    Ahuli nodded slowly in agreement, sharing in Rudy’s sense of isolation and uncertainty. "My people dispersed after the fighting," he stated matter-of-factly. “I don't expect to find anyone who shares my values here.” He paused, then added “But neither do I want to die alone trying to find them.”
A moment of shared understanding passed between them as both men recognized that survival now depended on mutual support and cooperation - a bond forged out of necessity rather than choice. Rudy shifted uncomfortably against the rock wall, his gaze fixed upon Ahuli who seemed to exude an air of quiet confidence despite their dire situation. “So… what’s the plan?” he asked tentatively, his voice barely audible above the rustling leaves outside the cave entrance.  “We travel together,” Ahuli stated without hesitation, his eyes unwavering as they met Rudy's gaze. “I know this land better than you do; I can guide us towards safety.” He paused to gather his thoughts before continuing "But we’ll need supplies for the journey."
    Without wasting any time, Ahuli began gathering materials from within the cave and surrounding area. He fashioned a simple bow out of flexible branches he found nearby, painstakingly stripping away bark and smoothing edges with sharpened stones. Next, he meticulously carved arrowheads from small pieces of flint, attaching them to straight shafts using strips of dried grass as binding material - an art honed by years of practice and experience on the reservation where he grew up.
    Rudy watched in awe as Ahuli's hands moved deftly between various tasks with skill and precision that demonstrated his deep connection to nature’s resources. It was clear that this man possessed knowledge and abilities far beyond what Rudolf, a pampered farm boy raised amidst comfortable surroundings, could ever imagine having learned or developed himself - further emphasizing the inherent imbalance in their strengths but also reinforcing their shared vulnerability as they faced an uncertain future together on this unforgiving land.  As Ahuli completed his makeshift bow and arrow set, he turned to Rudy with a determined glint in his eyes. "We'll need food, water, shelter," he declared confidently. “But first, we need to move before nightfall.”  The setting sun cast long shadows across the forest floor as we trudged along, Ahuli leading the way with an uncanny sense of direction I couldn't begin to comprehend. My stomach growled loud enough to echo in the stillness, reminding me just how far removed from civilization and comfort I truly was now. To distract myself from my hunger pangs – and probably out of nervousness too – I started talking about home.
    “You know,” I said, clearing my throat, "life back on the farm wasn't always like this." My voice caught slightly as I recalled images of fields stretching as far as the eye could see, ripe with fluffy cotton bolls ready for harvest. “Pa’s got a good piece of land down by the Arkansas River, and we usually have a bumper crop every year.”  Ahuli glanced over his shoulder at me, his expression unreadable in the fading light. I continued anyway, driven by an inexplicable urge to share details about my former life – perhaps as a way to prove that despite our current circumstances, there was still some semblance of normalcy left within me.
    “We depend on… well, we rely heavily on labor from other people to get things done,” I admitted reluctantly, stumbling over the words. It felt wrong even saying it aloud, but holding back would only make it worse later. “You see, Pa has a few families that work for him out of necessity.”  I paused, watching Ahuli’s reaction carefully. He didn't show any outward signs of judgment or disgust, which I supposed was something to be thankful for. "They pick the cotton, load up those big barges on the river, and haul it down to Memphis," I went on, adding more details about the process as if justifying my family’s reliance on this system. “Without them, Pa wouldn't have anything to sell, and we'd be destitute.”
    The thought of my parents struggling without the support of those families filled me with a sense of guilt, but it was also undeniable that they were essential to maintaining our comfortable lifestyle back home. I remembered watching those men – women too, come to think of it – working tirelessly under the scorching sun, their faces etched with exhaustion and despair. Yet, none of them complained; they simply accepted their lot in life, knowing full well that their families depended on it just as much as ours did.
    As I finished recounting my farm life, a wave of sadness washed over me, leaving me feeling strangely disconnected from the person I once was – a carefree boy living an idyllic existence far removed from this harsh reality. It seemed like a lifetime ago when I’d enjoyed leisurely evenings on the porch with my family, listening to stories told by the fire while sipping sweet tea and dreaming of future harvests. Now, all that felt distant and unreal, overshadowed by the uncertainty of our present situation and the daunting task of finding our way out of this wilderness alive.
    Rudy finished his story with a sigh that seemed heavy enough to carry the weight of all his guilt, leaving me staring at him in silence for what felt like an eternity. I took a slow, deliberate breath before speaking, wanting to choose my words carefully so as not to escalate the situation further than necessary.   “You mean slaves,” I said, letting those two simple words hang in the air between us. “The Black folks stolen from their homes and forced into servitude? You’re talking about the very people who built this nation on backs broken by pain and suffering.” My tone was measured but firm, revealing my disapproval of such practices without resorting to shouting or aggression.  Rudy shifted uncomfortably under my gaze, his face reddening slightly as he responded defensively, “It wasn't always like that, Ahuli. People needed help getting the cotton in, loading up those barges on the Arkansas River… they wouldn’t have been able to make a living otherwise.”
    I raised an eyebrow skeptically, not buying into his justifications for even one moment. "So you think it's okay to steal someone's freedom and force them to work against their will just so your family can prosper? Is that what you truly believe?" I challenged him directly, pressing the issue until he finally admitted that he had never questioned the system before now.  The argument continued for a while longer, with both of us stubbornly clinging to our respective viewpoints. It became clear that we saw the world through entirely different lenses – mine shaped by years of observing and experiencing injustices firsthand, his colored by privilege and ignorance. But eventually, a sense of exhaustion settled over us as we realized there was no point in continuing this futile debate.
    “Look,” I said, breaking the silence with a sigh that mirrored his earlier one. “We both want to survive out here, and that means working together regardless of our disagreements.” It wasn’t an apology or even an admission of wrongdoing on his part; it was simply acknowledging that survival depended on cooperation more than anything else at this point in time.
    Rudy nodded slowly, accepting my offer without protest. “Alright, I agree,” he said with a sigh. "Let's just focus on getting out of these woods and finding somewhere safer."   With our differences temporarily set aside, we started preparing for the next leg of our journey following the Buffalo River westward toward what they called the Oklahoma Territory, though it wasn’t quite that yet. We knew there were armed soldiers patrolling this area, so caution became our watchword as we navigated through dense undergrowth and across rocky terrain. Every rustle in the leaves or snap of a twig sent shivers down my spine, reminding me just how vulnerable we were to being discovered by someone who might not hesitate to shoot first.
    The realization hit us like a physical blow we were utterly lost, adrift in a sea of unfamiliar trees and overgrown pathways with no landmarks or signs to guide our way. The initial panic subsided into a grim determination as the gravity of our situation sunk in. We had both left behind everything we knew – families, homes, even simple comforts like a warm bed at night. Now, all that remained was each other and an overwhelming need for survival.  "Looks like we're on our own," I said with a weary sigh, scanning the dense forest around us. Rudolf nodded silently, his eyes darting about nervously as if expecting danger to spring from every shadow. He clearly hadn't been prepared for this kind of hardship; he was utterly helpless without someone else taking charge and showing him how things were done.  I decided it was time to put my knowledge of the land to use. "We need food," I declared, already moving forward with purpose. Rudolf followed reluctantly behind, tripping over roots and branches as he struggled to keep up. “Let’s start by looking for berries or anything edible we can find along the riverbank.”
    As we worked our way down the river's edge, my eyes scanned every bush and plant, identifying potential sources of nourishment while Rudolf clumsily tried to mimic my movements. He was a fish out of water, but I knew that even his limited skills would prove valuable if he just listened and learned from experience.
   We managed to gather a handful of wild berries – enough for a small snack - and later spotted a school of silverfish darting through the shallows. It took some effort, but I eventually caught a few using my bare hands while Rudolf watched in amazement. Once we had gathered our meager bounty, we stopped further downriver to build a fire and cook our catch over an open flame. As the aroma of cooked fish filled the air, it was impossible not to feel a flicker of hope amidst all that despair.  "This is good," Rudolf said hesitantly as he took his first bite, surprised by how satisfying even simple fare could be after days without proper nourishment. I simply nodded in agreement; we were both doing what we needed to do to survive.  During this break, my gaze fell upon a small pouch hanging from my belt my medicine bag filled with herbs and roots collected over years of foraging. It was essential for treating ailments and injuries out here, but also served as a reminder that I had knowledge that could help both of us in the long run. Rudolf’s attention, meanwhile, kept drifting towards his golden chain bearing a cross given to him by his mother before they left home - a constant connection back to the life he was desperate to reclaim.  As if on cue, Rudolf let out a sharp yelp and clutched at his side in pain. "My ribs," he groaned, wincing with each breath. Without hesitation, I remembered the aspen tree standing near by; its bark had potent anti-inflammatory properties that could ease his suffering. I quickly stripped off some pieces of bark from one of the trees, crushed them into a paste, and applied it to Rudolf’s injured ribs. Within moments, he felt a noticeable decrease in pain, relief washing over his face as if someone were easing away a heavy burden on him.  This moment solidified our bond, an unlikely alliance forged through necessity and mutual dependence. We may have been different men with vastly different experiences, but we were both lost souls clinging to each other for dear life amidst the uncertainty of this new world.
    The midday sun beat down relentlessly as we continued our trek alongside the winding riverbank. Rudolf complained constantly of thirst and exhaustion, but I pressed on, driven by an instinctual sense that something was amiss. It wasn't long before my premonition proved true – a shape lay slumped against the rocky terrain near the mouth of a small cave, partially obscured by overgrown vegetation.
"Look," I said, pointing to the figure with a mixture of apprehension and curiosity. Rudolf squinted in the bright light, then gasped as he made out the form lying prone on the ground. "Is that... is that someone alive?"  As we cautiously approached, it became clear the man was nearly lifeless – his skin an unsettling ashen gray under the harsh sunlight. He fell completely unconscious upon our approach, seemingly unable to muster even a flicker of response. We helped lift him carefully and carried him into the relative cool of the nearby cave for safety. It was while moving him that Rudolf reached into the man’s pocket and pulled out a smooth, dark rock. Without thinking, he started to toss it aside, deeming it useless or unimportant.
    “Hey!” I exclaimed sharply, stopping him mid-throw with my hand firmly on his arm. "Wait!" Rudolf turned, surprised by my intervention. “What? Why are you stopping me?” He gestured dismissively at the rock in his hand. “It’s just some old stone.”  “That boy has nothing else,” I replied, meeting his gaze directly. "Everything he has left is attached to that thing, so don't be so quick to discard it."
    Rudolf paused, considering my words for a moment before slowly lowering the rock back towards Biyogo (as we learned he preferred being called) who was starting to stir and regain consciousness as they brought him water from the river and what little remained of their meager meal – dried berries and fish scraps. As he began to awaken, his gaze drifted to the rock in Rudolf's hand before meeting my eyes with a look filled with gratitude and an unspoken understanding that this small object was more precious than anything else he had left.  Rudy fingered the cross hanging around his neck as they laid the nearly dead boy down and went to fetch so water for him.

    The cool air within the cave offered a welcome respite from the scorching sun. I knelt beside the boy, carefully tilting my cupped hands to offer him water drawn fresh from the nearby river. He drank greedily, his parched throat evident in the rasping sounds accompanying each swallow. Rudolf shared what remained of our meager meal – a handful of dried berries and a few scraps of fish – which Biyogo consumed with surprising force.
    "He's weak," Rudolf observed grimly, wiping some grime from his hands. "We need to find something more substantial for him."  I nodded in agreement. The sight of the gaunt man spurred us into action. Without speaking, we exited the cave and plunged into a desperate search for edible plants or any other source of sustenance. Our eyes scanned every inch of the landscape – thorny bushes, gnarled roots, even the rough bark of trees – anything that might hold some semblance of nourishment.
    As luck would have it, our persistence paid off. Tucked away amidst the dense undergrowth, we stumbled upon a muskrat burrowa muddy mound riddled with entrances and exits. Peering closer, we noticed signs of activity fresh tracks leading in and out, evidence that someone – or something – was home. An idea struck Rudolf. He snapped off a sturdy branch from a nearby tree and fashioned it into a makeshift lure, dragging it enticingly across the ground near one of the burrow entrances.
    We waited patiently, our eyes fixed on the entrance. After what seemed like an eternity, a sleek muskrat emerged cautiously from the depths of its home, sniffing the air with suspicion before approaching the branch. It was then that Rudolf seized his opportunity. With swift precision, he picked up a round river rock and hurled it directly at the unsuspecting creature. The blow landed true, dispatching the muskrat instantly.  Triumph surged through us as we returned to the cave, dragging our prize behind us. We gathered some dry leaves and twigs, quickly building an open fire outside the entrance. With skillful hands, Rudolf skinned the muskrat and put it over the flames, filling the air with a savory aroma that made all three boys stomach’s rumble in anticipation.
    The muskrat sizzled on a stick, its thin juices crackling as fat met fire. The smoke was bitter, but it was food, and no one complained.  Ahuli squatted near the flames, turning the stick slowly. Rudy sat cross-legged, hunched, flicking his pocket knife open and closed. The smallest of them sat a little apart, hugging his knees, the firelight catching the smooth stone he rolled between his palms.  Rudy looked up. “Roscoe,” he said casually, “that rock you always carrywhat’s it for?”  The boy didn’t answer at first. Just kept staring into the flames, rubbing the stone like it was something alive.  Ahuli shot Rudy a glance, not sharp, just... cautious.  The boy spoke without looking up. “Roscoe’s the name they gave me.”  The crackle of muskrat fat filled the pause that followed.  “My master's name. He said it was ‘good enough for a colored boy.’ That’s what they called me. Boy.”  He let the word hang there in the smoke, heavier than silence.  “But my real name... is Biyogo.” His voice was soft, but sure. “It means bringer of joy in Bantu. From my father’s side. He told me once, before they sold him south.”  Now he looked up. The firelight danced in his eyes, reflected in the polished curve of the dark stone.
 “I was born in a place called Gabon. I don’t remember it, but my mother did. She sang its name like a lullaby. She gave me this rock before she diedsaid it came from the riverbank near her village. So I’d always know I was more than what they tried to make me.”  Neither Rudy nor Ahuli spoke for a long while. The muskrat popped. A piece of ash floated up like a firefly and vanished into the dark.  Then Ahuli nodded once. “Biyogo.” He repeated the name, with care. Like it mattered. Like it was sacred.Rudy cleared his throat. “Bringer of joy…” He smiled, crooked and awkward. “Well... ain’t that something.”  The boyBiyogosmiled too. Not big, not loud. But real.  Rudy handed him a piece of burnt muskrat without a word.  From that night on, no one called him Roscoe again.  As they feasted on the cooked meat, we knew that this small victory had saved his life, a testament to their determination and resourcefulness in facing adversity.  A feast none of them would soon forget.
   The aroma of roasted muskrat still lingered in the air as we packed our meager belongings, ready to embark on a new phase of our journey. Biyogo, though visibly stronger after his meal, remained weak and needed constant support. We decided to follow the winding path of the Buffalo River westward – hoping it would lead us to civilization or at least some form of sustenance along its banks. Ahuli, ever observant and resourceful, wasted no time in preparing for this journey. He selected a strong oak branch from a nearby tree and meticulously crafted a proper bow, utilizing his knowledge of woodworking passed down through generations. Next came the arrows – sharpened sticks fletched with feathers scavenged from fallen birds. Armed with these new tools, he was ready to take on the role of scout and hunter, ensuring our survival along the way.
    With roles established, we set off towards the west. Ahuli took point, his keen eyes scanning the terrain for any signs of danger or opportunity. Rudolf diligently carried what little supplies we had – dried berries, a few remaining scraps of fish, and water skins filled from the river. Biyogo, still recovering but determined to contribute, focused on foraging for edible plants and roots as we moved along. Our first night camping was an exercise in awkward functionality. Finding a relatively flat spot near the river, we hastily built a small fire and huddled together for warmth and protection against any potential threats lurking in the darkness. Conversation was sparse – fatigue and uncertainty hung heavy in the air. Yet, there was a sense of camaraderie emerging between us as we shared this moment of quiet vulnerability, bound by our common goal of survival.
    The sun beat down mercilessly as we followed the Buffalo River, its waters reflecting the sky like a shimmering ribbon winding through the landscape. Each step was an effort, especially for Biyogo who still hadn't fully recovered from his ordeal. But we pressed on, driven by the faint hope of finding refuge and sustenance further west. The air grew thicker with anticipation as the distant sounds of human activity drifted towards usa promising sign that civilization might be within reach.  We approached cautiously, keeping to the dense foliage along the riverbank, until a small cluster of buildings materialized before our eyes a humble settlement nestled amongst rolling hills and towering trees. It  wasn't much – perhaps a dozen dwellings clustered around a central square where a general store and a blacksmith’s forge stood proudlybut it represented an opportunity we couldn’t afford to miss. We needed food, information, anything that could help us navigate this unfamiliar territory.  I took charge of crafting our cover story with swift efficiency. Rudy, blessed with his boyish charm and unassuming demeanor, would play the part of a farmhand seeking work on a nearby plantation. My role as a hired guide was simple to execute I’d scout ahead, ensuring their safety from any potential dangers that might lie hidden within the surrounding woods or hillsides. As for Biyogo… well, there wasn't much we could do about his appearance. He would be presented as a servant, an unfortunate position but one necessary for maintaining our illusion of normalcy and avoiding suspicion. It was uncomfortable, I knew, but this charade was essential to our survival.
    We entered the settlement with measured steps, keeping our heads down as we blended into the small crowd milling about in the square. The townsfolk regarded us with a mixture of curiosity and skepticism, their eyes scrutinizing every movement we made. Inside the general store, the proprietor, an older man with a weathered face and suspicious gaze, eyed us up and down before greeting us with a curt nod.
“Looking for something?” he asked gruffly, his voice raspy from years of shouting over the hustle and bustle of trade. Rudy stepped forward, attempting a hesitant smile as he launched into our rehearsed story about seeking employment on a nearby farm. I subtly positioned myself between him and the storekeeper, my hand resting lightly on the hilt of my knife – just in case.
    The questions began to flow relentlessly Where were we from? What was our experience like? How much did we expect to be paid? Each query chipped away at the fragile facade we had created. When he asked about Biyogo’s connection to us, I instinctively froze, realizing that this could expose our charade completely. “He's… uh… just traveling with us,” I stammered, hoping my voice wouldn’t betray my anxiety. The storekeeper narrowed his eyes, seemingly unconvinced by my hasty response. Just when it seemed like the situation was about to unravel, a gentle voice cut through the tension. "Don’t bother them, Silas," an older woman said as she approached us with a warm smile and outstretched hands. She introduced herself as Martha, the widow of a local farmer, and offered us slices of freshly baked cornbread. It was sweet, buttery goodness that melted in our mouths – a welcome respite from the constant worry we’d been carrying on our shoulders.
    “You look weary,” she said kindly, her eyes full of compassion. “Take these with you; they'll help get you through the day.” Before leaving, Martha warned us about regular patrols coming through town in search of potential runaways or deserters – an important piece of information that could prove crucial to our survival. As we thanked her profusely and left the store, I felt a wave of gratitude wash over me for this unexpected act of kindness from a stranger.
The frontier hospitality was undeniable, even if tinged with suspicion. We had successfully navigated our first test – but the journey ahead remained fraught with uncertainties and dangers. The river beckoned us onward, carrying its secrets deep within its currents, leading to an unknown future where survival depended on trust, adaptability, and a bit of luck along the way.
    As we walked away from the general store, I felt a pang of unease settle over me. The constant scrutiny of those townsfolk had been unnerving, but it was Martha’s warning about the patrols that truly sent shivers down my spine. My heart pounded in my chest as I struggled to keep pace with Ahuli and Rudy, feeling more vulnerable than ever before.  The cornbread, warm and comforting in my hand, was a small blessing in an otherwise daunting situation. It tasted like hope, a reminder of the kindness that existed even amidst hardship. But the weight of my own circumstances weighed heavily on me – being presented as nothing more than a servant to these two strangers had been deeply humiliating. I longed for a sense of purpose, something beyond mere survival, but all I felt was an overwhelming sense of inadequacy and fear. The river continued to lead us westward, carrying with it the echoes of our past mistakes and anxieties about what lay ahead. Yet, as the sun began to set, casting long shadows across the landscape, I couldn’t help but feel a glimmer of determination rising within me. Perhaps there was still something worth fighting for in this new world – perhaps we could find a way to forge a brotherhood out of our shared struggles, even if it meant enduring more hardships along the path. For now, at least, I had the cornbread and the company of these two companions, and that felt like enough to keep me going.
The world had narrowed to a tight band of green and brown as we pushed our way through the undergrowth alongside the river. The air hung heavy and humid, thick with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves. Biyogo lagged behind, his gaunt frame struggling against the tangled vines that clawed at his clothing. I kept glancing over my shoulder, trying to gauge how much further he was falling behind before Ahuli would notice. Our stealth wasn’t exactly perfect, but it had to be enough to keep us hidden from any casual observers.
    That's when I saw it – a faint disturbance in the distance, a cloud of dust rising above the treeline on the far side of the riverbank. My heart leaped into my throat as recognition dawned riders approaching at speed. "Ahuli!" I hissed, grabbing her arm and pointing towards the swirling dust. "Riders! Coming fast!"
he didn’t waste any time responding, her eyes scanning the surroundings with an almost preternatural awareness. Her gaze darted from one detail to another - broken branches, trampled foliage, disturbed ground – piecing together a mental map of the approaching threat. Without hesitation, she led us off the main trail and into a dense thicket where sunlight barely penetrated the canopy above.
    The undergrowth was even more suffocating here, but it offered cover as long as we kept quiet and still. We crouched low to the ground, feeling the damp earth clinging to our skin like a second layer of clothing. The sounds of hooves pounding against the dirt grew louder with each passing moment, echoing through the trees like an approaching storm. “They’re getting closer,” Ahuli whispered, her voice tight with tension. She began working feverishly at gathering loose branches and foliage to create a false trail leading away from our hiding spot, all while keeping one eye on the advancing riders. The image of their faces flashed through my mind - stern, hardened men who wouldn't hesitate to shoot first and ask questions later if they suspected anything amiss. Sweat trickled down my temples as I tried to control my breathing, every muscle in my body screaming for release from this unbearable pressure. It felt like an eternity before the patrol finally passed within yards of where we were hidden – so close that I could practically smell their horses' sweat and hear the jingle of their gear. The tension peaked at its highest point as we remained frozen in place, praying that they wouldn’t notice us or even glance back to check for any signs of pursuit.
    The pounding hooves faded into the distance, leaving behind a deafening silence punctuated only by the frantic beating of my heart. Once the riders were well out of sight, Ahuli signaled it was safe to emerge from our hiding place. As we stumbled back onto the trail and looked at each other, I realized just how vulnerable we’d been during that encounter. Biyogo's eyes widened with fear as he spoke for the first time in what felt like hours "That was too close! We could have gotten shot!" His voice trembled slightly, betraying the deep-seated terror he had experienced throughout the ordeal. I found myself nodding in agreement, feeling a surge of adrenaline coursing through my veins despite being safe now.
    In that moment, something shifted between us - an unspoken understanding forged by our shared experience of near-death. It wasn't just about survival anymore; it was about supporting one another as we faced the dangers that lay ahead. The fear we had felt together became a bond, solidifying our alliance and strengthening our resolve to press on despite everything. Even though I didn’t express it aloud, I knew that Ahuli understood exactly what I meant. We were in this together now, no matter what came next, bound by the memory of those pounding hooves and the knowledge that we had escaped death by a hair's breadth.
My stomach gnawed at me, a constant reminder of how long it had been since our last proper meal. Berries were fine for staving off starvation, but they weren’t exactly filling. Every step felt heavier as I trailed behind Ahuli and Biyogo along the riverbank. The silence between us was thick with unspoken anxieties – we all knew our situation was dire, but no one wanted to voice it out loud. It was almost suffocating, this quiet desperation that hung in the air.

    Suddenly, Ahuli stopped dead in his tracks, his eyes scanning the dense undergrowth ahead. “There,” he said softly, pointing towards a break in the foliage. A small, emaciated deer stumbled into view – its ribs clearly visible beneath its patchy fur. It was pathetic really, but at least it was something.
"A chance for real sustenance," I blurted out before realizing how loudly I'd spoken. Ahuli nodded in agreement and started to move forward, disappearing effortlessly into the shadows as if he were a part of the forest itself. Biyogo and I exchanged glances; his expression mirrored my own mixture of hope and apprehension.  Ahuli put his finger to his lips in the univeral shush sign and I watched with bated breath as he stalked closer to the unsuspecting deer. The suspense was almost unbearable as he drew back his bowstring, aiming an arrow directly at its heart. A moment later, a single whoosh of air signaled the release,  followed by the unmistakable thud of the arrow hitting its mark. I let out a shaky breath, feeling a wave of relief wash over me as the deer collapsed in a heap.
    Biyogo seemed unaffected by my earlier squeamishness and efficiently started to skin the animal while Ahuli began carving out portions for us all. It was fascinating watching him work; his hands moved with such precision and skill that I couldn't help but feel impressed, even though the sight of blood still made me a little queasy.  Now it was my turn. Biyogo handed me a knife, and despite my initial reluctance, I got to work on cleaning up some scraps for myself. The smell of freshly cooked venison filled the air as we feasted around our newly built campfire. This time, there was no gnawing emptiness in my stomach – just a warm sense of satisfaction and gratitude for having secured this precious meal.
    As the embers crackled merrily, Ahuli began to speak, his voice low and gravelly. "Been a long time since I've seen an animal so skinny," he said with a hint of nostalgia in his tone. He went on to tell us about growing up as a hunter amongst nomadic tribes who roamed the vast plains beyond our current location - they lived off whatever nature provided, just like we were doing now but for many years longer than we had been together. "We'd often find animals struggling to survive during harsh winters," he recalled, his eyes distant and pensive. Biyogo chimed in with a story about his time working on an agricultural farm back home - he mentioned how they used specialized tools to efficiently harvest crops and raise livestock. His stories helped me understand that survival wasn’t just about physical strength; it was also about adaptability, resilience, and knowing when to rely on others for support.
   The firelight danced upon our faces as we continued sharing anecdotes from our past lives – moments of joy, pain, loss, and triumph all interwoven into a tapestry of shared experience. The campfire became more than just a source of warmth; it was a gathering place where we could forge stronger bonds with each other while reminiscing about what brought us here in the first place.
    The warmth of the fire seeped into my bones, easing the gnawing emptiness that had plagued me for days. The roasted venison tasted like heaven compared to the blandness of berries, each bite a small victory against this unforgiving wilderness. It was odd how such simple things – food, shelter, companionship – could feel so monumental after everything I’d been through. We sat in comfortable silence, the crackling flames providing a soothing soundtrack to our shared exhaustion. Ahuli and Biyogo seemed content just to be present, their faces illuminated by the dancing light. They didn't push me to talk or ask questions; they simply allowed the moment to unfold naturally.
    As I stared into the heart of the fire, lost in contemplation, a memory surfaced from deep within – one that had been buried beneath layers of trauma and denial for far too long. Almost without realizing it, I began speaking, my voice hushed as if sharing a secret with the flames themselves. "I... I saw something horrible once," I started hesitantly, feeling the words catch in my throat. The heat from the fire seemed to intensify as I delved into that dark corner of my past.  The chaos of Pea Ridge rushed back to me – the thunderous roar of cannons, the screams of men and horses, the acrid smell of gunpowder hanging heavy in the air. It was a battlefield of unimaginable destruction, where life was cheap and death came swiftly and mercilessly. I had been just a boy then, barely seventeen years old, drafted into service like countless others from our county. We were green recruits, ill-equipped to face the seasoned veterans on the other side.
    I remembered standing shoulder to shoulder with the boy next to me – we’d both grown up in the same small town, attended the same church services, played together as kids. I knew his name was Caleb; he must have been about sixteen then, full of youthful energy and eager to prove himself a man. He had loaded his musket, ready to charge into the fray with unwavering determination when suddenly... half his head vanished in a shower of crimson spray. The sound was sickening – a wet crack followed by a gurgling gasp that echoed across the battlefield before being swallowed by the din of war.
    The image burned itself onto my mind’s eye - Caleb's lifeless eyes staring blankly up at the sky, his body slumping to the ground as if falling from grace. I couldn't bear it any longer. Something inside me snapped, and a primal instinct took over – the need to escape, to survive. Without thinking, without looking back, I ran. I bolted across the battlefield like a scared rabbit, dodging fallen soldiers and abandoned weapons, pushing myself further and faster than I ever thought possible. I didn't stop running until my lungs burned and my legs trembled with exhaustion. Only then did I realize that I had outrun the sound of cannons, the smell of gunpowder, the horror that had consumed me moments before. The memory felt like a nightmare – one from which I could never truly wake up. Shame washed over me as I looked at Ahuli and Biyogo, wondering what they thought of my confession. Had I revealed myself to be a coward? A deserter who abandoned his comrades in their hour of need? The guilt gnawed at my insides, threatening to consume me entirely. But as I met their gaze, I saw no judgment, only quiet understanding. They didn't offer platitudes or empty reassurances; they simply listened, allowing the silence between us to speak volumes about the shared burdens we carried.
    For the first time since meeting them, a sense of vulnerability washed over me  a feeling that I could be truly seen and accepted for who I was, flaws and all. This moment marked more than just an exchange of stories around a campfire; it forged a bond between us – one built on shared experiences and unspoken empathy. The fire crackled merrily as we settled deeper into the night, knowing that we had taken another step towards becoming something akin to family. Ahuli leaned back against a fallen log, his face illuminated by the dancing flames. He took in my story, then nodded slowly, “Sometimes survival demands choices we don't like,” he stated with surprising gentleness, his voice carrying an almost haunting quality. "There is no shame in finding your way out of harm's reach; it’s just a matter of perspective.” He paused for a moment, then added quietly, “I too have seen things that would make you weep, Rudy." With that, he closed his eyes and seemed to drift off into sleep, leaving me alone with my thoughts. His words resonated deep within me – they were an affirmation of the choices I had made and a reminder that we all carry our own burdens in this world.
    I looked over at Biyogo who was carefully adding more wood to the fire. He caught my gaze and gave me a small, reassuring smile before returning to his task. The warmth from the flames enveloped us all as we settled into the rhythm of the night – two men and an animal companion united by circumstance in this vast, unforgiving wilderness.
    The morning after Rudy’s story broke open, the world felt different. The air itself seemed quieter, as if holding its breath. I watched him as we packed the last of the deer meat, wrapped carefully in large leaves Ahuli had found. Rudy didn't look like a boy who had run from a battle. He looked like a boy who had run from a ghost, and the ghost had followed him here, to the banks of this river, to sit with us by the fire. I understood that kind of ghost. I carried a whole village of them in my own memory.  My name is Biyogo. I say it to myself, a silent rhythm against the squelch of my worn shoes in the mud. Bi-yo-go. It feels solid, like the river stone in my pocket, a weight I can trust. The name Roscoe was a cloud of smoke, something that choked you if you breathed it in too deep. Biyogo is the earth. My mother gave me the stone, and my father gave me the name. It is all I have of them that the masters could not sell or whip away.
    We walked for what felt like two days, the river our constant, murmuring companion. Ahuli moved like a shadow at the head of our small procession. His silence was not empty; it was full of listening. He read the bent grass and the overturned stones like a book I couldn’t decipher. Rudy walked in the middle, his eyes often downcast, the gold cross his mother gave him catching the dappled sunlight. He was quieter now, the bragging shell of the farm boy cracked open to show the soft, uncertain man inside. I walked last, my body still a weak and clumsy vessel, but my eyes were sharp. Bondage teaches you to watch. It teaches you that the flick of a master's wrist, the tightening of a jaw, the dust kicked up far down a roadthese are the real words, the ones that decide if you eat or if you bleed.  It was my eyes that caught it first. Not a clear sign, like a footprint, but an absence. A patch of wild berries, stripped clean in a way no animal would. Animals are messy. This was neat. Methodical. Hungry. I said nothing, but quickened my pace a little to get closer to Ahuli. Before I could speak, he stopped, holding up a single hand.
    He knelt, his fingers hovering over the ground. I followed his gaze and saw it a single, dark thread tied to a sapling, nearly invisible against the bark. It was a snare line, but not for rabbits or squirrels. It was low to the ground, meant to trip something on two legs, not four. It was a warning.  Rudy came up behind us, breathing hard. “What is it? You see somethin’?” His voice was a loud intrusion in the heavy silence.  Ahuli put a finger to his lips, his eyes sweeping the dense canopy of cypress and oak ahead. He pointed. A thin wisp of smoke, paler than a cloud, struggled to rise above the trees. It wasn’t the thick, confident smoke of a military camp or a settler’s cabin. It was the smoke of a fire trying to hide.  “Stay here,” Ahuli whispered, his voice a dry rasp. “And stay quiet.”  He moved forward, vanishing into the foliage so completely it was as if the forest had swallowed him whole. Rudy fidgeted, his hand going to his cross, then to the knife on his belt. His fear was a scent in the air, sharp and sour. My own heart was a frantic drum against my ribs, but my hands were still. Fear was an old friend. I reached into my pocket, my fingers closing around the smooth, cool weight of my river stone. Biyogo. It calmed the drumming in my chest. I wasn't Roscoe the runaway. I was Biyogo, the son of a singer from Gabon. I had survived the unsurvivable. I would survive this.
    Minutes stretched into an eternity. A bird called, answered by another. Then, silence again. Rudy started to speak, but I shot him a look that froze the words in his throat. Then Ahuli was back, appearing as silently as he had left.  “People,” he said, his voice low. “A few. Hiding. They have lookouts.”  “Soldiers?” Rudy asked.  Ahuli shook his head. “No. Not soldiers.” He looked directly at me, his dark eyes holding a question. “They look… like you, Biyogo.”  A cold dread and a spark of fierce hope warred in my belly. My people. Here. But to be found was to be caught. To be caught was to be returned. And to be returned was a fate worse than any death this wilderness could offer.
    “We need to be careful,” I said, my voice barely a whisper. “They’ll be scared. They’ll see him,” I gestured to Rudy, “and see a threat. They’ll see you,” I looked at Ahuli, “and they won’t know what to see.” The Cherokee had fought with the South. This was a truth that tangled everything.  “We are three hungry men, not a patrol,” Ahuli stated, ever the pragmatist. “We need supplies. We should approach. Show we mean no harm.”  “And how do we do that?” Rudy sputtered. “Just walk in there waving?”
     It was my turn to lead. I knew this path, though I had never walked it before. It was a path paved with fear and suspicion. I stepped forward. “I’ll go first,” I said. “You two stay a ways back. Let them see me alone. Let them see I am no threat. Then, when I call, you follow. Slowly. With your hands where they can see them.”  Neither of them argued. Ahuli gave a slow, measured nod. Rudy looked pale, but he agreed.  I took a deep breath and pushed through the final screen of ferns. The camp was a small, desperate clearing carved into the heart of the woods. Ramshackle shelters made of fallen branches and patched blankets leaned against ancient tree trunks. A small, smoky fire pit was at the center, a large iron pot simmering over it. But my attention was fixed on the people. A dozen, maybe more. Gaunt faces, eyes wide with a permanent, hunted look I knew from every looking glass I’d ever glanced in. Women were mending clothes that were more holes than cloth. Two small children played a silent game with pebbles near a tree root.
    And then I saw the lookout. A tall, powerfully built man with graying temples stood half-hidden by a cypress tree, a sharpened sugar cane knife held loosely in his hand. His eyes locked onto mine, and the camp fell utterly silent. The children froze. The women stopped their work. Every eye was on me.  I stopped, holding my empty hands up, palms forward. My heart hammered against my ribs. One wrong move, one wrong word, and that cane knife would be buried in my chest.  “I mean no harm,” I said, my voice hoarse. “I am… a traveler. I am lost.”
    The tall man stepped out from behind the tree. His face was a mask of hard-earned suspicion. “Ain’t no ‘lost’ out here,” he rumbled, his voice deep and gravelly. “You’s either runnin’ from something, or you’s huntin’ somethin’. Which is it, boy?”  The word ‘boy’ struck me like a whip. But his use of it was different from the master’s. It wasn’t a denial of my manhood; it was a challenge.  I let my hands fall slowly to my sides. “Running,” I said, meeting his hard gaze. “Same as you.”
    A murmur went through the small crowd. The man’s eyes narrowed. He took a step closer, his knuckles white around the handle of the cane knife. “You alone?”  This was the moment. “No,” I said clearly. “I have two others with me. They are back in the trees. They are also… running.”  “Running from what?” he demanded. “The war?”   “From everything,” I said. I had to make him understand. “We ain’t Blue or Gray. We are ghosts. Just trying to pass through.”  “Who they be?” he pressed, his gaze flicking to the woods behind me. “Bring ‘em out. Let’s see these ghosts of yours.”
    I turned and cupped my hands around my mouth. “Ahuli! Rudy! Come forward! Slow!”  I heard the rustle of leaves, and then they appeared. Ahuli, tall and silent, his bow held loosely in one hand, his face unreadable as stone. And Rudy, his face pale and blotchy, his eyes darting nervously from the wary faces in the camp to the man with the knife. He looked exactly what he was a scared white boy, completely out of his element.  The instant the tall man saw Rudy, his whole body tensed. “A white boy,” he spat, the words dripping with a century of venom. “You bring a white boy into our midst? Are you a fool, or a traitor?”  Several other men in the camp moved forward, their hands reaching for makeshift weaponsheavy branches, sharpened rocks.
    “He is not what you think!” I said, stepping between them, my hands raised again. “He ran from the fight, same as us! His people…” I faltered, looking at Rudy’s shamed face. “His people were masters. But he is not his people! He is just… Rudy.”  The leader, whose presence was so immense he had to be the one in charge, laughed, a bitter, humorless sound. “Not his people? The fruit don’t fall far from the  poison tree, boy. And what of this one?” He nodded toward Ahuli. “An Indian. Cherokee, by the look of him. Watie’s men raid settlements for the slavers. How we know he ain’t one of them?”  The tension was a bowstring pulled to its breaking point. Rudy looked like he was about to bolt. Ahuli stood impassive, but I could see a muscle twitch in his jaw. I had to do something. I reached into my pocket and pulled out my river stone. I held it out on my open palm.  “My name is not boy,” I said, my voice shaking but finding a strength I didn’t know I possessed. “My name is Biyogo. It means ‘bringer of joy.’ My father gave it to me, before they sold him. My mother gave me this stone. It is from her home, a place called Gabon. She told me to hold it so I would always know I was more than what they tried to make me.”  I looked the leader in the eye. His hard gaze flickered down to the stone, then back to my face.  “We found him,” I said, nodding to Rudy, “bleeding and half-dead in the woods. His own people would have let him die. This man,” I gestured to Ahuli, “healed him. He shared his skill, his food. We have shared fire. We have shared stories. We are not soldiers. We are not masters. We are just… broken pieces. Trying to find a safe place to land. Just like you.”
    The silence that followed was so profound I could hear the hum of a fly near the simmering pot. The leader’s eyes, which had been like chips of flint, seemed to soften for just an instant. He looked from me to Ahuli, then to Rudy, who was staring at the ground, his face a mask of misery and shame.  Then an old woman with a face like a beautiful, wrinkled map stepped forward from the fire. She carried a wooden bowl that smelled of herbs and greens. “Moses,” she said, her voice frail but steady. “The boy speaks truth. Look at them. They ain’t got no hate in their eyes. They just got fear. And hunger. Same as us.”  She stopped in front of me, her own eyes, cloudy with age, peering deep into mine. “Biyogo,” she repeated softly. “That is a good, strong name.”  She then turned to Rudy. He flinched as she approached. She looked him up and down, then held the bowl out to him. “You look starved, child,” she said.  Rudy looked up, his eyes wide with disbelief. He looked at the bowl, then at the old woman, then at the man he now knew as Moses. He slowly, hesitantly, reached out and took the bowl. “Th-thank you, Ma’am,” he stammered.
     Moses watched the exchange, his face still grim, but the hand holding the cane knife had relaxed. He gave a sharp, almost imperceptible nod. The tension in the camp broke like a fever. The other men lowered their makeshift weapons. The children started whispering again.  The old woman, who told us her name was Hettie, ladled out two more bowls of the thin, watery stew for me and Ahuli. It was mostly wild greens and some kind of root vegetable, but it tasted like the finest feast I had ever had. As I ate, I looked around the small, hidden circle of survivors. I saw the quiet dignity in their faces, the resilience etched into every line and wrinkle. Here, in this forgotten pocket of the wilderness, was a tiny, flickering flame of freedom. And for the first time since I had felt the mud of my own plantation fall away from my heels, I felt a strange and unfamiliar warmth spread through my chest. It wasn’t just the stew. It was something more. It felt like hope. It felt, I realized with a start, like joy. I rolled the river stone in my pocket. The bringer of joy was, at last, closer to home.
    We discoved an abandonded cabin in the woods later that day and spent our first night in shelter since the cave by the river.  The biting morning air sent shivers crawling down my spine as we emerged from the dense thicket. The landscape had undergone a striking transformation – rolling hills replaced by rugged terrain punctuated with jagged rocks and gnarled pines. A deceptive beauty masked an underlying tension; it was almost peaceful until those blue uniforms materialized on the path ahead, shattering any illusion of tranquility. Five men, their faces grimly set, scanned their surroundings like hawks eyeing prey. Deserter hunters - a chilling thought that sent a jolt through my body. This wasn’t going to be easy.  Biyogo moved first, as he always did, his movements fluid and silent as he navigated the undergrowth. He kept a close eye on our pursuers, attempting to outflank them while simultaneously gauging their intentions. “Stay low,” I whispered urgently, ducking behind a substantial boulder, Ahuli mirroring my actions and disappearing into the shadows. The air hung heavy with anticipation; every rustle of leaves sounded like an impending doom, amplifying the dread that gnawed at my gut. It all rested on Biyogo’s shoulders now – our survival depended on his quick thinking and resourcefulness.
    Then came a moment that would forever change how I perceived him - it was truly remarkable. With a calculated audacity, he stepped out from cover, approaching those soldiers directly, hands raised in surrender. A desperate gamble? Perhaps, but there was an undeniable confidence radiating from him, a steely glint in his eyes that suggested a deeper understanding of the situation than I could possibly comprehend.  “Please, sirs,” he said calmly, his voice unwavering despite the palpable tension, “I’m an escaped slave being helped to freedom.” He spoke with such conviction and sincerity that it almost felt like he believed every word himself. The lead soldier scrutinized him from head to toe, his gaze piercing and assessing, but Biyogo met his stare unflinchingly, revealing nothing of the fear churning within him. I watched hidden behind my rock, captivated by this display of unwavering resolve as Biyogo elaborated on our situation, gesturing towards Ahuli and me with a casual ease that seemed almost mocking of their suspicion. And then… it worked.
    The soldiers paused, exchanging glances filled with disbelief and confusion. The leader finally nodded, his expression unreadable “Alright then, you’re on your own path now. We will escort you part of the way out of this territory.” A wave of relief washed over me as they lowered their weapons, signaling that we were safe – at least for now. They began marching down the road, Biyogo leading the charge - a bizarre twist of fate, ironic protection indeed.  The sheer audacity of it all hit me like a physical force. He’d tricked them! Not with brute strength or cunning manipulation, but with an understanding of how they viewed the world – as people who might be more inclined to help someone in dire need than capture another deserter. Biyogo had tapped into their inherent decency and twisted it for our benefit; he's truly something special.  As we marched alongside those soldiers, exchanging polite small talk about the weather and the journey ahead, I found myself watching Biyogo with a newfound respect. He’d always been resourceful – quick on his feet, skilled in survival tactics - but this was an entirely different level of brilliance. This wasn't just about avoiding capture; it was about manipulating perceptions, understanding motivations, exploiting weaknesses. It was the kind of intelligence that transcended mere instinct and entered the realm of genuine mastery.  The soldiers finally reached the end of their patrol area, offering words of encouragement as they turned back towards home. Biyogo smiled wryly, his eyes sparkling with satisfaction "They didn’t know it was just a disguise," he said softly, a hint of amusement in his voice. I couldn't help but feel a surge of admiration for this man who had managed to outwit seasoned Union soldiers using nothing more than wit and charisma.
    I remembered the earlier encounter when we were forced into hiding as those men passed by – how Biyogo’s quick thinking saved us from capture, allowing us time to regroup and devise a new plan. His ability to assess situations swiftly and make calculated decisions under pressure was truly remarkable; it reminded me of the countless other times he'd pulled through for us when things looked bleakest.  The shooting’s  flashed in my mind - the frantic scramble for cover as bullets whizzed past, Biyogo’s cool demeanor even amidst chaos, his ability to pinpoint enemy positions and direct our movements with unparalleled accuracy. I realized then that his leadership wasn't about issuing orders; it was about inspiring trust and confidence through action, demonstrating a level of competence that demanded respect from everyone around him.  And now here we were, being escorted out of danger by those same soldiers who had been hunting for us just moments ago – thanks to Biyogo’s extraordinary skills. The irony of the situation wasn't lost on me; it was like watching a chess master checkmate his opponent using their own pieces.
    As we resumed our journey, leaving behind the safety provided by those unlikely protectors, I realized that something profound had shifted within me. Biyogo wasn’t just another companion on this path; he was an undeniable force to be reckoned with, someone my father saw as property was  a master strategist who could turn any situation to his advantage. He's truly one of kind and someone you can trust in times like these. And for the first time since we started this perilous journey, I felt a genuine sense of hope, knowing that as long as we had each other, no obstacle would prove insurmountable. The sun began setting on the horizon, painting the sky with vibrant hues of orange and purple – a beautiful sight to behold after such intense turmoil, all thanks to Biyogo's cunning intellect and unwavering resolve. He truly earned my respect in this moment; he is an exceptional person and ally whom I am fortunate enough to have by my side.
    The crackling fire cast dancing shadows on our faces as we huddled together for warmth and solace after that harrowing encounter with the Union Deserter Hunters. Biyogo’s quick thinking had undoubtedly saved us from certain capture; his actions still fresh in my mind served as a constant reminder of his extraordinary abilities. Relief washed over me, but it was tempered by exhaustion – both physical and emotional. The near-death experience left its mark on all of us.  “So,” I began, breaking the comfortable silence that had settled between us, “how did you know exactly what to say to those soldiers? You seemed to anticipate their questions perfectly.” His voice held a mixture of awe and genuine curiosity as he gazed at Biyogo, searching for answers in his enigmatic expression. The firelight reflected in Rudy’s eyes, highlighting the intensity of his gaze.  Biyogo remained quiet for an extended period, lost in thought. He slowly rotated his sacred stone between his fingers, a small smooth piece of granite that he carried everywhere as a source of comfort and guidance. The rhythmic movement seemed to amplify the tension hanging in the air. Finally, after what felt like an eternity, he began speaking, his voice low and measured.  “It all started back on the plantation near Little Rock,” Biyogo began, his words carrying the weight of years gone by. “Master Roscoe was a cruel man – he worked us slaves until we dropped, pushing us beyond our limits every single day.” He paused, taking a deep breath before continuing. "The night I decided to run… I heard the guns getting closer, knew things were about to get worse."  He recounted how Master Roscoe had brutally punished anyone who dared to question his authority or even show signs of exhaustion. Biyogo described witnessing countless acts of violence and suffering, etching themselves into his memory like scars on his soul. The details he shared painted a vivid picture of the horrors they endured under that oppressive regime – each word dripping with pain and resentment.  “There was one particular incident,” Biyogo recalled grimly, “when a young boy named Samuel tried to steal some extra food for his starving sister. Master Roscoe caught him in the act and beat him mercilessly right in front of everyone.” He shuddered at the memory, his voice trembling slightly as he relived that horrific moment. The firelight seemed to dim as if echoing Biyogo’s anguish.
    "That was when I knew," Biyogo continued, "I couldn't stay there any longer. The fear for my own life had subsided and been replaced by a burning desire for freedom." He spoke with newfound resolve, his eyes reflecting the unwavering determination that propelled him forward even amidst such despair. “So, I planned my escape meticulously, studying their routines and searching for opportunities to slip away undetected.”  Biyogo explained how he’d learned to read people – understanding their motivations, anticipating their reactions, and exploiting any weaknesses they might have possessed. This skill proved invaluable in his conversations with the soldiers earlier that day; allowing him to manipulate them into believing his story of being a deserter seeking refuge from Union forces. The sacred stone continued its silent rotation between Biyogo’s fingers as he recounted his harrowing journey – each turn bringing forth another memory, another lesson learned along the way.  Peace settled over us as we drifted off to sleep, awakened at every tiny noise, drifting back to sleep in the comfort of our company.
    The rain had been relentless for days, swelling the Arkansas River into a churning brown torrent. It was too high to ford safely, and our progress ground to a halt at its banks. We scanned the muddy shoreline, searching for any sign of passage – a fallen log, perhaps, or an abandoned boat. Nothing. Just endless water rushing past, carrying debris and unseen dangers. Despair began to creep in as the sun dipped low behind the horizon, threatening to leave us stranded on this desolate stretch of land.
"We're stuck," I muttered, kicking at a loose pebble. "Looks like we'll have to camp here until the water recedes." Beside me, Biyogo simply nodded, his expression unreadable as always. He seemed unfazed by our predicament, perhaps used to adversity after all he had endured on that plantation in Little Rock. As dusk deepened, a distant sound caught my attention – the rhythmic splash of oars cutting through the water. Following its direction, we spotted an approaching skiff powered by two men struggling against the strong current. They looked weary but determined as they maneuvered closer to our location.  “Lost, are ye?” one of them called out in a raspy voice, wiping sweat from his brow with a calloused hand. “This river’s been angry lately.” His eyes twinkled with amusement as he took us in – Biyogo's quiet intensity, my own weariness from the recent events, and the desperate hope clinging to our faces.  "Yes," I replied, stepping forward cautiously. "We need to get across if possible. Is there any way to do so, we have dried venison to trade?" The other man added, “Name’s Jebediah, this here is Ebenezer, we run a ferry service when the river allows it." He gestured towards their sturdy wooden skiff, which appeared well-suited for navigating the turbulent waters.
    We boarded the small vessel, taking our places in the back as the two men skillfully rowed us downstream alongside the bank. The current was powerful, requiring constant effort from Jebediah and Ebenezer to maintain a steady pace against its force. As they pulled on their oars, I noticed that one of them had an injured arm – likely from some recent mishap along the river.  The journey wasn't without peril either; we narrowly avoided colliding with submerged logs and swirling debris carried by the relentless current. Both men expertly navigated around these obstacles, demonstrating a clear familiarity with the treacherous conditions of the Arkansas River during flood season. The rain continued to fall in sheets as the skiff drifted further downstream until finally reaching an old dirt road carved out along the riverbank.  "There's a place just ahead where we can dock," Ebenezer announced, pointing towards a makeshift landing area constructed from stacked rocks and fallen trees. Once ashore, Jebediah took us to his shack nearby where he offered us shelter for the night in exchange for helping him repair some damaged netting that had caught on an underwater snag earlier in the day.
    Over dinner of boiled potatoes and salted pork, we learned more about the region and its inhabitants from Jebediah and Ebenezer's stories – tales of hardships, struggles against poverty, but also resilience, courage, and unwavering determination to build a better life for themselves amidst adversity. They shared their experiences with us like they were fellow travelers on this uncertain path forward through 1862’s tumultuous landscape, forging an unexpected bond over simple meals and shared experiences under the glow of a flickering lantern lamp in the dimly lit shack. As we settled down to sleep that night, I reflected upon our encounter – appreciating not only their assistance but also recognizing how such moments of mutual aid exemplified the enduring spirit of those who dared to carve out lives for themselves on this untamed frontier.
    The midday sun beat down mercilessly as we trudged into Harmony Ridge, our ragged clothes and weary faces betraying our desperate flight. We were three lost souls seeking refuge from the storm of war, hoping to blend in with this forgotten place. As we approached the central square, where a few buildings stood scattered around an empty space, suspicion hung heavy in the air. The locals, hardened by hardship and wary of outsiders, watched us intently. An old man with piercing eyes sat on a porch swing, sizing us up like prey animals. He seemed to know something about our situation - or at least suspecting it. Biyogo tugged at my sleeve, his voice barely above a whisper "Look out." His warning was enough to make me aware of the danger we were in.  Desperate for food and water, we decided to risk approaching the general store, hoping to trade some venison for provisions. The shopkeeper, a burly man with calloused hands and an unfriendly gaze, was reluctant to help us out. We offered him our dried meat, but he seemed unimpressed by it - “Ain’t much use to me boys” He scrutinized our clothes, then let out a loud chuckle before turning back to his work, leaving us feeling unwelcome in this place. It appeared getting supplies might prove more difficult than we initially thought.
     As we turned away from the store, Ahuli was stopped by an older woman who stared at him with a mixture of surprise and recognition. "You got Cherokee blood in you, boy? I can see it clear as day," she declared, pointing a gnarled finger towards his face. Her accusation sent shockwaves through our group - we had tried to hide Ahuli’s Native American features for fear that they would make us even more vulnerable. The crowd of locals began to close in on us, their expressions shifting from suspicion to hostility. Someone shouted out an insult about “half-breeds” and the tension escalated quickly between us and the townspeople. It seemed our attempt at blending into the background had backfired spectacularly - now we were cornered by a group that was determined to see us punished for something we didn't even know we were guilty of.  Realizing that we needed to act fast, I stepped forward to take control of the situation. Using my best imitation of a charming Southern accent, which was honed from years spent listening to my grandfather's tall tales on the farm, I began spinning a story about how we were experienced hunters and trackers searching for game in these parts. "We are here tracking a prized buck," I said with confidence, trying to convey an air of authority that would help us escape this predicament. The locals seemed intrigued by my quick thinking and knowledge of local wildlife - they didn’t seem inclined to believe the accusation about Ahuli's heritage yet. With each passing moment, their curiosity grew, creating a brief window for us to make our move.  My improvised story worked like a charm - as I continued weaving my tale of tracking the elusive buck through the Ozark wilderness, the crowd began dispersing slowly, intrigued by my confidence and knowledge of hunting practices. However, their suspicion never fully subsided - they still watched us with wary eyes while going about their daily routines in Harmony Ridge, making it clear that we were walking on a tightrope between safety and danger. We knew we couldn't stay here for long if we wanted to avoid becoming the focus of another accusation or attack.  As we slipped away from the town, I felt a surge of confidence in my ability to outsmart these suspicious locals and keep our group safe. My fast-talking skills and knowledge of farm life had saved us from certain disaster - at least for now. The experience gave me an unexpected boost of self-assurance as we continued on our journey towards Fort Smith, knowing that every step was another chance to escape the perils of war and find a new place to call home.
    The embers of the fire clung precariously to life, casting dancing shadows across our faces that seemed to mock the exhaustion etched into every line. Each crackle sounded like an approaching footstep, each gust of wind felt like a probing gaze searching for weakness. We were vulnerable now, more than ever before. The close call at the settlement had left us raw and exposed, clinging together in this desolate clearing as though that alone could somehow protect us from whatever lay ahead. Rudy broke the silence first, his voice low and cautious. “You always seem to know what’s coming, don't you?” he said, looking at me with a mixture of admiration and apprehension. I chuckled then, but it was more bitter than amused. A hollow sound in the quiet night. “Had to learn fast when they came for us,” I replied, my voice rough around the edges from disuse. It wasn’t bravado; it was simply stating a fact that had been seared into my very being. The memory of those days felt like a phantom limb – always there, aching with an unhealing wound.
    The fire shifted, throwing a fresh wave of warmth across my face. I closed my eyes for a moment, letting the heat wash over me as I plunged back into the past, drawn by the irresistible pull of memory. I saw it all so vividly still - our village nestled in the heart of the Cherokee Nation, a haven of peace and tradition. It was a place where ancient ways thrived alongside the rhythm of everyday life. Our homes were built with cedar logs and thatched roofs, blending seamlessly into the surrounding forest. Children played games of tag amongst the trees while women tended to their gardens filled with corn, beans, and squash. Men hunted deer and elk for sustenance, ensuring that everyone would have enough to eat. We lived a simple life, but it was one full of purpose and meaning. We respected our ancestors’ customs, honoring the spirits who guided us through generations. The elders shared stories of our heritage, keeping alive the flames of tradition in each new generation. I remember spending hours listening to their tales, soaking up every word as if my life depended on it.
    It was a good life, one filled with love and belonging. But that all changed when those blue-coated Yankees arrived. They weren’t emissaries or diplomats; they were conquerors in disguise. Their eyes held no trace of kindness, only the cold glint of ambition and greed. The way they swaggered into our village made me feel small and helpless.  Their leader, a man with a thick mustache and an arrogant smirk on his face, stepped forward to deliver their ultimatum “Fight for us or we’ll burn your homes, take your land anyway.” It was the most brutal thing I had ever heard, stripping away any semblance of dignity in one swift sentence. He didn't offer any incentives; he only presented a choice between submission and devastation. There were whispers among our people about what to do. Some argued for resistance, believing that they could drive out the invaders if they stood together. Others advocated surrender, hoping that appeasement would bring an end to their suffering. But it was my father who ultimately made the decision a few of us would fight alongside them, providing support and intelligence in exchange for protection from further harm. It was an agonizing choice, one that tore at our hearts but seemed like the only way to save what remained of our community. My anger still burns when I remember it all - the humiliation of being forced into service against those who claimed dominion over us. “They called it volunteering,” I spat out again, my voice shaking with suppressed rage, “but men with guns don’t ask.” The hypocrisy was nauseating. They presented their demands as an opportunity for collaboration, but we knew from the start that they had no intention of treating us as equals.
    The march away from our village was a blur of misery and despair. I watched my mother's face crumple as she realized what was happening, her eyes filling with tears she tried desperately to hide. My siblings clung to each other for comfort, their small bodies trembling with fear. As we walked further and further into the unknown, I couldn’t shake off the feeling that something terrible was about to happen. The soldiers were merciless in their treatment of us - pushing us forward without regard for our pain or exhaustion. They took what little food and supplies we had left, leaving us weak and vulnerable on the road.  The worst part was not knowing whether I would ever see my family again. Every step felt like a betrayal of everything I held dear. It was as if a piece of my soul had been ripped away and replaced with an unbearable emptiness. All hope seemed lost in that moment, swallowed by the vastness of our suffering. The experiences I endured during those harsh times shaped me into the person I am today. The constant fear, the violence, the loss - it all contributed to a sense of wariness that never truly leaves. But there’s also something else – an ability to read danger, to anticipate threats before they materialize. It's as if my instincts have been heightened by the trauma, allowing me to spot subtle changes in people and situations that most others wouldn't notice. I suppose it's a survival mechanism - honed through necessity over years of hardship. “That’s why I can sense when something is wrong,” I explained to Rudy and Biyogo, looking at each of them intently. “I had to learn fast; it was the only way to stay alive.” The memory of those days served as a constant reminder of what could happen if I let my guard down, so I always stayed alert, watching for any sign that things were about to turn bad.
    We fell silent again, the crackling fire providing our only company in this desolate place. But now, there was something more than just vulnerability in the air - a shared understanding of what we had been through and how it shaped who we are. We all knew firsthand what it meant to be hunted and oppressed, to have one’s life torn apart by forces beyond control. Rudy spoke up first, his voice soft but resolute. "I get it now," he said, nodding slowly. "This whole thing…it's not about honor or glory. It’s just people trying to survive." He had experienced the horrors of war firsthand as well, losing everything he held dear in one fell swoop. Biyogo finally found his voice too, a quiet strength emerging from within him. “I never knew anything else,” he said, looking at each of us with unwavering determination. “Except being hunted.” His words resonated with the same pain and resilience that I felt deep inside. Despite all we had endured, there was still something left to fight for - the hope of a better future, a chance to reclaim our lives from those who sought to destroy them. As the fire burned lower and the night grew colder, we huddled together for warmth and comfort, finding solace in each other’s company. We were three souls united by hardship and loss, bound by a shared determination to overcome any obstacles that stood in our way. The journey ahead would be difficult, but at least now we had found strength in numbers and an unwavering sense of purpose - the will to survive and ultimately find peace once again.
    The crackling embers of the dying fire cast flickering shadows across our faces as Biyogo’s words hung in the frigid night air. I could feel the weight of his resilience settling upon us all – a quiet strength born from enduring hardship. His declaration, “I never knew anything else…except being hunted,” echoed my own thoughts and solidified the bond forged by shared trauma. Despite everything we had lost, there was still something left to fight for - that glimmer of hope for a better future, a chance to reclaim our lives from those who sought to destroy them. The chill intensified as the fire dwindled, forcing us closer together for warmth and comfort. We huddled like scavengers seeking refuge in this desolate wilderness, finding solace in each other’s presence – three weary souls united by loss, fueled by an unwavering determination to overcome whatever lay ahead. The first hint of dawn painted the eastern sky a pale grey as we prepared for our next move approaching Fort Smith. The looming fortifications promised both danger and potential salvation, forcing us to strategize carefully. We needed to replenish vital supplies before making contact with any settlements or people. Our plan was simple – find shelter under an abandoned railroad bridge just outside of town where we could stash the necessities while planning how best to enter without drawing attention. To ensure success, only I could safely venture into Fort Smith for provisions due to my familiarity and ability to blend in, minimizing suspicion.
    The list of critical needs hung heavy on my mind an axe for protection and clearing obstacles, sturdy rope for climbing or securing our escape route, a gun for defense against potential threats was out of reach, we’d have to make due with our wits,and medical supplies to tend to any injuries we might sustain along the way. The weight of responsibility pressed down upon me as I prepared to face this perilous undertaking alone. A knot formed in my stomach, a familiar sensation accompanying every risky decision. Tension crackled between us like static electricity as Biyogo voiced his concerns for my safety while Ahuli’s anxious gaze followed me with an intensity that mirrored his own fears. "Be careful," he whispered, reaching out to touch my arm reassuringly. Biyogo simply nodded, acknowledging the gravity of the situation and offering silent support. I forced a smile, trying to reassure them despite the doubt gnawing at my insides. The stakes were higher than ever before; this was our biggest risk yet – infiltrating Fort Smith and securing the necessary resources for survival.
    As I prepared to leave, I took one last look back at Ahuli and Biyogo huddled together in the shadow of the railroad bridge. Their expressions reflected both worry and a quiet resolve that mirrored my own. The journey ahead would be fraught with peril, but we faced it together – three souls bound by hardship and loss, driven by an unwavering will to survive and reclaim our lives from those who sought to destroy them. I took a deep breath, steeled myself against the unknown dangers that awaited me, and stepped into the dawn's pale light toward Fort Smith, hoping my choices would lead us towards salvation and not further despair.
    The sun blazed down on Fort Smith's chaotic main street as I stepped into its heart. The air hung heavy with a blend of sweat, stale beer, gunpowder, and cheap tobacco, all vying for dominance in my nostrils. Around me, cowboys swaggered out of saloons, federal marshals patrolled with grim faces, merchants hawked their wares, and the constant clamor of drunken singing and brawling created an almost unbearable din. Looming over it all was the stark reminder of justice – a six-man gallows in the town square, its presence casting a long shadow over everything.
I navigated through this maelstrom alone, keeping my head down and trying to blend into the rough crowd that flowed around me. The sheer density of people pressed against me on every side, making progress slow and difficult. My fingers instinctively tightened around the worn leather satchel slung across my chest – our lifeline for survival, filled with supplies we desperately needed to continue our journey. A familiar warmth radiated from beneath my shirt where I wore the gold cross given to me by my mother, a memento of simpler times back home in Tennessee. The thought crossed my mind could I trade this precious heirloom for what we needed? But then, I remembered the hard work and sweat-soaked chores we'd performed at remote settlements along our path – enough money saved from those laboring jobs to cover our needs.
    My objective was clear find Johnson & Sons Mercantile, a general store mentioned by locals in the last village,spurred me onward through the crowd, dodging belligerent patrons stumbling from nearby saloons and avoiding collisions with other desperate travelers. Finally, I spotted it “Johnson & Sons Mercantile” emblazoned across a weathered wooden facade. Inside, Silas Johnson, a burly proprietor with greasy hands and an even greasier apron, scrutinized me as I approached his counter. He sized up my worn clothes and hesitant demeanor before finally barking out, "What'll it be, stranger?"
    I laid out our list an axe, rope,and some basic medical supplies. Silas grumbled about inflated prices due to recent supply shortages because of the war but reluctantly filled our order after I paid the with the money we’ed back at the last settlement. As I exited the store, clutching the precious cargo, a wave of relief washed over me - we had what we needed for now.  My moment of respite was short-lived. Just as I turned onto another street, disaster struck. A trio of drunken teenagers stumbled out from a nearby saloon, their eyes bloodshot and unsteady. In an effort to avoid colliding with one of them who appeared about to fall into the path of an oncoming cart, I accidentally bumped into another, spilling his whiskey across my front.
    “You spilled my whiskey, farm boy!” he roared, his face contorted in rage as he lunged for me, followed by his two companions. Panic surged through my veins - this wasn't what I had bargained for. Without a second thought, I bolted down the muddy street, dodging horse-drawn carriages and weaving between pedestrians. The shouts of the enraged teenagers echoed behind me as they pursued their vengeance with surprising speed despite their intoxication. The chase led us on a frantic dance through Fort Smith’s chaotic streets. I ducked under low-hanging signs, slipped around corners at breakneck speeds, and dove into crowded saloons to shake off my pursuers. My farm-boy agility proved invaluable as I leaped over obstacles and navigated the treacherous terrain with ease. Remembering my knowledge of horses from years spent working on our family farm, I quickly assessed potential escape routes involving these animals, calculating distances and trajectories in a split second. One saloon led to another, each more crowded than the last. The air grew thick with the smell of stale beer, sweat, and desperation as I pushed through the throng, desperately trying to lose my pursuers amidst the chaos. One particularly narrow alleyway provided me an opportunity - squeezing past a group of arguing men, I burst out onto a side street just as one of my chasers rounded the corner.
    I spotted it – a livery stable crammed with horses and carriages. Without hesitation, I slipped inside through an open gate, blending in with the activity as quickly as possible. The pungent aroma of hay and manure filled the air as I hid amongst the stables, watching from behind a stack of feed bags as my pursuers stormed past without noticing me.  As soon as they were out of sight, I emerged from my hiding place, taking stock of my surroundings. All seemed clear - for now. Gathering my courage, I made sure to keep an eye out while returning to the main street and carefully retracing my steps back towards where Ahuli and Biyogo were waiting, hidden beneath a nearby railroad bridge. As soon as they saw me coming down the trail,their faces lit up with relief. "You did it!" exclaimed Ahuli, his eyes filled with gratitude. "We owe you big time, Rudy."  Biyogo nodded in agreement, his dark face etched with a mixture of weariness and hope. "Thanks to your quick thinking, we have everything we need for the next leg of our journey." I smiled at their expressions, feeling an unexpected surge of confidence wash over me despite the dangers that lay ahead, we were ready to face them together as one team again.
    The damp earth clung to my boots as we slipped out from under the railroad bridge, leaving behind the relative safety – and stench – of its shadowed recesses. The celebration had been brief but genuine, a quick exchange of relieved smiles and grateful nods before Rudy led us away from Fort Smith, pushing deeper into the surrounding wilderness. Ahuli's easy laughter felt almost alien to me after so much silence, his youthful enthusiasm contrasting sharply with the grim determination etched on my own face. I couldn’t bring myself to fully join in their excitement just yet; too many memories of failed attempts and heartbreaking losses lingered at the back of my mind. Still, seeing them find such joy in this small victory filled me with a strange sense of peace – perhaps there was still hope for us all after all.
    The Indian Hills loomed ahead, rising like jagged teeth against the horizon. These weren't gentle slopes or rolling fields; they were raw, unforgiving terrain carved by centuries of wind and rain. Thick undergrowth choked every inch of space, making progress slow and arduous. The air grew thick with the scent of pine needles and damp soil as we moved deeper into the wilderness, leaving behind any semblance of civilization. Rudy took point, expertly navigating through the dense foliage using his axe to clear a path while Ahuli followed close behind, humming an old  Cherokee prayer that seemed strangely fitting in this wild landscape. I brought up the rear, my senses on high alert for any sign of danger lurking within the shadows. Years spent surviving on the fringes had taught me how to listen closely and observe carefully – it was a skill that had saved my life more times than I could count. The sun began its descent, casting long, eerie shadows across the forest floor as we continued our journey. The temperature dropped rapidly, sending shivers down my spine despite the layers of worn clothing I wore. We found a small clearing near a fast-flowing stream and set up camp for the night. It was far from luxurious – just enough space to lay out our meager belongings and huddle together against the biting cold – but it was infinitely better than sleeping in the open or under the bridge back in Fort Smith.
  The axe proved invaluable as we gathered firewood, its sharp edge slicing through dead branches with ease. The rope came into play when lashing together a makeshift shelter from fallen logs and pine boughs, creating a surprisingly sturdy structure that offered some protection from the elements. We even managed to snare a few small rabbits using an improvised trap – adding much-needed protein to our diet after weeks of meager rations. As we sat around the crackling fire, sharing the roasted rabbit meat with gusto, I couldn’t help but feel a sense of optimism creeping into my heart. For the first time in what felt like an eternity, I wasn't consumed by fear or despair; there was something about this simple act of survival that filled me with a quiet satisfaction. It reminded me of a simpler time, when life revolved around basic necessities and the bonds between people were forged through shared hardship. Ahuli leaned back against a log, gazing up at the star-studded sky above us. “It’s beautiful out here,” he said softly, his voice barely audible over the crackling fire. "Makes you forget all about what we left behind." Rudy nodded in agreement, adding with a grin, "We're going to be alright, Biyogo. I can feel it."
    Their words resonated within me, stirring up long-dormant emotions of hope and resilience. Maybe they were right – maybe this sanctuary wasn’t just some distant dream after all. Maybe we could actually make it through this ordeal, together as a team, finding strength in each other's presence and drawing on the skills that had kept us alive until now. As I looked out at the vast expanse of wilderness stretching before me, I couldn’t help but feel a sense of wonder mixed with determination. The Indian Hills were challenging, unforgiving, even dangerous, but they also held the promise of safety, security, and perhaps even something more – a chance to rebuild our lives from the ashes of what we had lost.
   The fire burned down to embers as exhaustion took hold, sending us all into a deep, dreamless sleep. I woke up before dawn, stiff and sore but strangely invigorated by the fresh air that filled my lungs. The sun was just beginning to peek over the horizon, casting a warm glow on the surrounding landscape. It was another day in paradise – or at least as close to it as we could hope for given our circumstances.
    The chill morning air bit at my exposed skin as I emerged from the remnants of our makeshift shelter. The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clung to me, mingled with the faint aroma of roasted rabbit – a welcome reminder of last night’s meager feast. As if on cue, Rudy and Ahuli stirred, stretching their limbs in unison before joining me at the edge of the clearing. The sunrise painted the sky in hues of orange and pink, illuminating the dense forest ahead and casting long shadows across our path. It was a picturesque scene, but my gaze drifted towards the distant ridge where I’d spotted movement earlier that night – three figures on horseback, their silhouettes barely visible against the fading starlight. They were following us, relentlessly pursuing the faint trail we'd left behind.
   “Looks like company,” I said grimly, gesturing toward the ridge with a nod of my head. Rudy’s eyes narrowed as he scanned the horizon, confirming what I already knew. “Bounty hunters, most likely,” he muttered, his hand instinctively reaching for the worn handle of his axe. Ahuli followed suit, pulling out his hunting knife and inspecting its edge with practiced ease. It was clear that this idyllic moment had been shattered by the unwelcome intrusion of our pursuers.  "We need to get moving," I said, my voice low and urgent. “The sooner we put some distance between us and those riders, the better.” Rudy took charge, scouting ahead with his familiar swagger and assessing the terrain for any potential dangers. Ahuli, meanwhile, began studying the ground beneath our feet, meticulously examining every hoofprint and broken twig that might offer clues about the bounty hunters' movements or tactics. It was a testament to how much we had learned from each other in these past few days - Rudy’s innate ability to navigate treacherous paths combined with Ahuli’s keen eye for detail created an unstoppable force when working together as one.
    My own experience as a slave during those dark years had taught me the art of predicting human behavior, especially that of captors and pursuers. I drew upon this knowledge to anticipate their actions, analyzing every sign of movement or change in direction with laser focus. With our combined skills, we formed an efficient team, ready for whatever challenges lay ahead. The rocky terrain proved treacherous as we set off at a brisk pace. Jagged boulders jutted from the ground like menacing teeth, and slippery patches of moss coated the rocks, making each step precarious. We moved swiftly but silently through the undergrowth, relying on our instincts to avoid detection. The bounty hunters’ presence loomed large in my mind, pushing me onward with an adrenaline rush that kept fatigue at bay. Rudy led us along a narrow canyon wall, where we could utilize its steep incline as cover. It was a risky maneuver, but it provided ample concealment while allowing us to maintain our momentum. We pressed against the cool stone of the canyon walls, feeling every tremor and echo as we crept forward.
    Ahuli’s sharp eyes caught sight of something in the distance - a flash of metal glinting off sunlight through the trees. "They're gaining on us," he whispered urgently, his voice barely audible over the rush of wind whipping around us. “We need to find somewhere better to hide.” Rudy reacted instantly, leading us into a dense thicket of thorny bushes that obscured our presence from any onlookers. We pushed through the tangled branches and prickly stems, emerging on the other side with scratches and scrapes but hidden once again from view. The bounty hunters were closing in fast; we could hear their horses' hooves pounding against the rocky ground as they drew nearer to our location. "They’re right behind us," I muttered, my heart pounding in my chest. “We need a plan, and we need it now.”
    Rudy pointed towards a small cave hidden amongst the rocks above us. "There's an opening there; maybe we can squeeze inside before they spot us." It was a long shot but worth taking if it meant avoiding capture or worse. We scrambled up to the entrance of the cave, dodging falling stones and loose debris as we made our ascent. Just as we were about to slip into the darkness of the cave, one of the bounty hunters spotted us. The man let out a shout and spurred his horse forward, charging towards our hiding place with reckless abandon. Rudy reacted quickly, throwing himself in front of the opening, using his axe to create an instant barrier between us and the incoming rider. The collision sent both men tumbling into the dense undergrowth below, leaving Ahuli and me exposed for a brief moment. The other two bounty hunters saw their opportunity and shifted their focus towards our location, but before they could react, Rudy managed to get back on his feet with incredible speed, intercepting them at the mouth of the cave. A fierce struggle ensued as he fought off both riders while Ahuli and I slipped inside the narrow opening, taking refuge in the darkness within. The sounds of clashing steel and desperate shouts faded away as we huddled together in silence, our breaths coming in ragged gasps. We had narrowly escaped capture, thanks to Rudy’s quick thinking and unwavering courage. It was a testament to how far we'd come – from disparate individuals struggling for survival to a cohesive team capable of facing down any challenge thrown our way. As Ahuli rejoined us,I couldn’t help but feel an overwhelming sense of pride in my companions. We had faced danger head-on and emerged victorious, proving that unity and resilience were indeed powerful weapons against adversity. The Indian Hills may have been unforgiving, but we were stronger than ever before – a family forged by hardship and bound together by the shared desire to live another day. We hid in the depths of the cave for a few hours before we carefully resumed our journey.

    The chill in the air bit at my exposed skin as we emerged from the cave, leaving behind the hidden spring and its ethereal glow. Rudy, ever vigilant, kept a wary eye on our surroundings, scanning the dense forest that cloaked the slopes of the mountain. We had been tracking signs for hours now, trying to put some distance between us and those bounty hunters who’d chased us into the cave earlier. Each rustle of leaves or snap of twigs sent a jolt of anxiety through me, but we pressed on, knowing there was no other choice if we wanted to survive. The trail led us deeper into the wilderness, winding along treacherous paths that snaked up and down steep inclines. The terrain grew increasingly difficult, requiring constant focus and balance as we navigated the uneven ground. I glanced back at Rudy, who seemed unfazed by the challenging conditions, his muscles taut and ready for any unexpected encounters. We hadn’t spoken much since leaving the cave, both of us lost in our own thoughts about how to get out of this situation alive. The silence felt heavier than usual, adding to the sense of dread that weighed on me. My stomach growled with hunger, reminding me we had been traveling for hours without food or water. As we rounded a bend in the trail, I spotted something unusual ahead - a cluster of colorful wildflowers blooming amidst the rugged landscape. The vibrant hues stood out against the backdrop of gray rock and green foliage, creating a stunning display that momentarily distracted me from my worries. Rudy caught sight of them too, and he paused to take a look, his expression softening slightly as he observed their beauty.
    “Those are Mountain Lupines,” he said softly, pointing towards the blooms with a nod of approval. “They only grow in certain conditions, so finding them here means we’re on a path less traveled.” His words sparked something within me – a flicker of hope that maybe, just maybe, this journey wouldn't be as hopeless as I initially thought. The lupines were like beacons of light in the darkness, reminding us that even in the most challenging circumstances, there was always room for wonder and beauty. We continued onward, our steps filled with renewed determination. The trail led us to a rocky outcrop overlooking a vast valley below. From this vantage point, we could see miles of rolling hills stretching out before us, covered in lush vegetation. The sight was breathtaking but also unsettling – it felt like being trapped between two worlds the familiar safety of our previous lives and the unknown perils that lay ahead.
    As the sun began to sink lower in the sky, casting long shadows across the valley floor, we stumbled upon a small clearing where a stream trickled down from above. The sound of running water was music to my ears, and I rushed towards it with eagerness, cupping my hands together to drink deeply from its clear, cool flow. Rudy followed suit, taking several sips himself before wiping his mouth with the back of his hand. “We need to find shelter soon,” he said after a moment, looking around at our surroundings with concern. “Nightfall is coming fast, and we don’t want to be caught out in the open.” I scanned the area for signs of a suitable place to rest, eventually spotting an overhanging rock formation that could provide some protection from the elements. We made our way towards it, setting up a makeshift camp as best we could with what little supplies we had left. The night was long and cold, but the sense of camaraderie between us kept me warm enough. As I lay huddled next to Rudy under the rocky overhang, gazing at the stars shining above, I couldn’t help but feel grateful for his presence – he had become more than just a companion; he was my protector, my guide, my friend in this uncertain world.
    In the morning light, we were greeted by another surprise - a small grove of fruit trees bearing ripe apples and peaches. The sight brought tears to my eyes as I realized how lucky we were to have found such abundance after so much hardship. We feasted on the delicious fruits, savoring each bite like it was the last one we would ever taste. Refueled and energized, we continued our journey deeper into the wilderness. As we walked, Rudy began teaching me about farming and I responded by teaching him about animals by following signs of their movement broken twigs, disturbed leaves, even subtle changes in the scent of the air. He explained that these details could tell us a lot about where an animal might be heading or if it had recently passed through the area. I listened intently to his instructions, absorbing every word like a sponge, eager to learn from his expertise and improve my own survival skills. Days turned into weeks as we pressed on, always moving forward with hope in our hearts. We encountered various challenges along the way – steep cliffs to scale, dense thickets to navigate, even wild animals that posed potential threats - but each time we faced them head-on and emerged victorious, stronger and more resilient than before. I found myself growing more confident in my abilities, feeling less like a helpless victim of circumstance and more like an active participant in shaping my own destiny.
  One evening, as we set up camp near a fast-flowing river, Rudy pointed out something remarkable – ancient petroglyphs carved into the smooth surface of a large boulder. The intricate drawings depicted scenes from long ago - animals hunting, people gathering food, and symbols that seemed to hold some kind of significance. I stared in awe at these glimpses into the past, wondering about the lives of those who had created them so many years before. I explained that these petroglyphs were likely left behind by an indigenous tribe that had once inhabited this area, possibly Cherokee people like myself. He spoke with a sense of pride and reverence for their culture, reminding me of my own heritage and connection to the land. It was as if we had stumbled upon a piece of history, connecting us to those who had come before us. As time went on, our bond grew even stronger, we three forged by shared experiences and unwavering support. We laughed together, cried together, and faced danger together – always looking out for one another's well-being. I realized that Rudy wasn’t just a protector;he was family in every sense of the word. One day, while scouting ahead on a narrow ledge overlooking a deep canyon, Rudy spotted something far below - a faint plume of smoke rising from within a dense forest. He quickly signaled me over and we peered down together, trying to make out what might have caused it. The fire was small, but its presence suggested that someone else had managed to survive in this remote wilderness. "Someone's there," Rudy said, his voice filled with a mixture of excitement and caution. "We should go check it out." I hesitated for a moment before nodding my head in agreement. After all the hardship we had endured, maybe finding another person could be an opportunity to forge new alliances or gain valuable resources.
The humid air hung thick and heavy, a suffocating blanket woven from the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves. My muscles screamed in protest as I scrambled up the moss-covered embankment, pushing aside tangles of vines to catch my breath. The sun, a hazy disc behind the dense canopy above, offered little warmth, but its presence served as an unsettling reminder of how long we'd been trekking through this unforgiving landscape. Beside me, Rudy’s breathing was ragged and labored, his face slick with sweat. We had been following faint tracks for hours, hoping to find some sign of civilization – any indication that others had ventured into this forgotten corner of the world.
    That hope shattered as abruptly as a branch snapping underfoot when we crested the ridge. Before us lay a clearing bathed in an eerie twilight glow, and filling it were dozens of figures clad in buckskin and feathers, their faces painted with vibrant dyes, spears held aloft like menacing extensions of their arms. They were Osage warriors, clearly marking this territory as their own. The sight sent a jolt of pure adrenaline through my veins, freezing me momentarily in place. Rudy hissed beside me, his hand instinctively reaching for the hunting knife strapped to his thigh. "Osage," he muttered, his voice barely audible above the pounding of my heart. “We need to go.” I knew he was right, but something held me back – a strange sense of anticipation mingled with apprehension that settled deep within my gut.
These weren’t just any warriors; they were seasoned veterans, their bodies hardened by years of conflict and survival in this harsh environment. They moved with an almost unnatural grace, their eyes scanning the clearing with unnerving intensity, as if searching for some hidden threat. The air crackled with tension, thick enough to taste, and I could feel every muscle in my body coiled tight like a spring.
    As we stood there frozen in place, one of the warriors let out a guttural cry that echoed through the clearing, shattering the stillness. It was an alarm, immediately followed by another, and then another, until the entire group erupted into a cacophony of war cries and shouts. I watched as they slowly turned towards us, their spears raised in unison, forming a deadly wall between us and any chance of escape. Rudy pulled me behind him, shielding me from view with his body, and began to back away cautiously. But before we could take another step, a tall figure stepped forward from the ranks – an imposing man adorned with elaborate headdresses and necklaces made from teeth and claws. He was clearly their leader, radiating authority in every gesture and movement.
    I recognized him instantly - a seasoned warrior named Chayton, known throughout the region for his cunning and ferocity. I had heard tales of his exploits during previous encounters between our tribes, and they always ended with bloodshed and suffering. This time felt no different. The tension was palpable, suffocating even, as Chayton’s gaze locked onto mine through the gap in Rudy's protective arm.
But something about this standoff felt…different than the stories I’d heard. These warriors weren’t displaying outright aggression; they were testing us, assessing our mettle, gauging whether we posed a genuine threat or simply lost travelers stumbling into their territory. This realization sparked an idea in my mind - one that could potentially diffuse the situation and turn this perilous encounter into something else entirely. Ignoring Rudy's panicked whispers urging me to retreat, I took a deep breath and stepped forward, leaving him exposed for just a moment before continuing on my own toward Chayton. The warriors stiffened as I broke away from Rudy’s protection, their spears held even higher, but they didn't advance. It was an unspoken acknowledgement of the challenge I had presented – a silent declaration that this wasn’t going to be easy for either of us. As I got closer to Chayton, I could see the curiosity in his eyes mingling with suspicion and caution. He remained stoic, but there was a flicker of something unreadable deep within his gaze. When I reached him, just close enough that I could smell the smoke from his campfire on his clothes and feel the heat radiating off his body, I performed what we called “counting coup.” With lightning speed, I reached out my bare hand and touched the leader’s arm - a gesture of respect and bravery without resorting to violence.
    The silence that followed was deafening, broken only by the rustling of leaves in the breeze. Chayton didn't react immediately, but after a long moment, he let out a low grunt, a sound that seemed to acknowledge my daring display. I took this as an opportunity to speak, launching into a mixture of Cherokee and trade language – a common tongue used by many Native tribes across the region. “Greetings, Chayton,” I began, keeping my voice calm and steady despite the pounding in my chest. “I am Ahuli, son of Na'ahni, from the Cherokee people. My companions and I mean no harm to your village or territory.” I paused, allowing my words to sink in before continuing. "We are simply travelers seeking shelter and guidance on our journey." My knowledge of their customs, honed over years spent listening to elders tell stories around campfires and trading with other tribes, proved invaluable as I continued speaking. I spoke of shared beliefs and traditions, emphasizing the importance of respect for all living things and the need to maintain peace among different nations. I also mentioned my familiarity with the local flora and fauna, offering to share my knowledge in exchange for safe passage.
    As I spoke, Chayton’s expression softened slightly, his eyes losing some of their intensity. He listened intently to every word I said, occasionally nodding his head as if agreeing with my sentiments. When I finished speaking, he remained silent for a moment before finally responding in the trade language. “You speak well, Ahuli,” he said, his voice low and resonant. "Your words carry wisdom that is rare among outsiders.” He then gestured towards one of his warriors who stepped forward to open a path through the ranks. “Passage will be granted, but remember this respect our traditions, and we shall return the favor. Disrespect us, and you’ll find yourselves facing consequences far more severe than any storm or hardship you’ve encountered so far.”  I bowed my head in acknowledgement of Chayton's words and turned to follow the path that had been cleared for us. As I did, I caught a glimpse of Rudy watching from behind, his face filled with both relief and astonishment at what had just transpired. Biyogo was further back among the trees where he’d hidden himself earlier in the day, but I could still feel him observing our progress through the dense foliage. With this successful negotiation secured, we were finally able to move on, leaving behind the hostile territory of the Osage warriors and continuing on our journey with renewed hope for a brighter future ahead. My actions had not only established my cultural knowledge but also demonstrated my courage in the face of danger - earning me the respect of those who might have otherwise seen us as enemies. The experience served as a powerful reminder that diplomacy, when wielded skillfully, could be an even more effective weapon than any spear or blade.
 Campfire Scene 4 Reflections on Identity & Belonging

    Biyogo stared intently into the flames, his face etched with a melancholic expression. He hasn’t said much since their escape from the Osage village, his usual boisterous energy dampened by an unspoken weight. Rudy is whittling a piece of wood, his brow furrowed in concentration as he attempts to carve it into a small bird Ahuli watched them both, his own thoughts swirling within him. The success with the Osage has left him feeling strangely unsettled, as if something fundamental about himself has been shaken loose in the process. He'd found strength he didn’t know he possessed but now wondered at the cost of wielding that power.
    The fire danced and flickered, mirroring the chaos within me. Home… it was a word that tasted like ash on my tongue. My real home – the place where I belonged - had been stolen from me long ago. The plantation...a cage of forced labor and cruelty. Running away wasn't freedom, just another kind of captivity. Being hunted by those who sought to re-enslave me was constant fear. Now, even when safe with these two boys, it still lingered in the shadows, a phantom pain reminding me what I had lost my family, my heritage, everything that defined me as a person. I longed for a place where my name mattered, where people knew who I am and what I've been through. Not just another escaped slave to be hunted down. A place where my story would be told with respect and dignity. But finding such a sanctuary seemed impossible, like chasing after smoke in the wind. Would I ever find a place where I could truly belong?  Biyago was carving that bird, his hands sure and steady even as he wrestled with unspoken anxieties. Ahuli watched us both, his gaze filled with understanding but also something else – an uncertainty that mirrored my own. We were all lost souls searching for something beyond survival, a deeper meaning in this world of chaos and cruelty. Biyogo paused, pushing aside some embers from the fire. I miss the smell of Mama’s cooking, the sound of laughter among my kin. It wasn't always easy, but it was home – where our struggles made us stronger together. Now, there is just this relentless search for something that may not even exist. He looked up at Ahuli and then to Rudy, a flicker of hope igniting in his eyes. Maybe… maybe we can build our own place, create a new kind of home where everyone belongs. A place where no one needs to hide their past or fear the future.
    The little bird was proving more difficult than I anticipated. The wood kept splintering and cracking under my knife, much like my own heart felt at times. Going back wasn't an option anymore, not after everything that had happened. That life - the one on the plantation – it was all built on a foundation of lies and oppression. My parents worked themselves to death for scraps from the master’s table while he feasted on his ill-gotten gains. I couldn’t live like that again.
I thought leaving meant freedom, but now realized that running away only delayed the inevitable reckoning with my past. The memories of those days haunted me – the whippings, the hunger, the constant fear of being caught. I yearned for a place where hard work was rewarded and people were treated with respect, not like livestock to be bought and sold. But where could that place exist? The world seemed filled with more cruelty than kindness, more exploitation than opportunity. Even though I'd escaped physical slavery, the chains of societal expectations still bound me. I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was destined to repeat my father's fate trapped in a cycle of endless toil and despair. Rudy sighed, Home… it used to mean Mama’s apple pies and Papa’s tall tales by the fireplace. Now, it means escaping the past while forging ahead into an uncertain future, all alone, y’know he said “I’ve heard tales about California, out west on the big ocean, sounds nice and they don’t have slaves.” he finished. He glanced at Biyogo, who had just shared his painful memories of his stolen heritage. He's right though… we need to create our own homes because no one else will ever give it to us. We can be each other’s families in a world where family doesn't always mean blood. Rudy looked up at the sky, finding comfort in the vastness of space. The stars are constant, unchanging… they remind me that there is something bigger than my pain and suffering, something beautiful beyond comprehension. Maybe building our own home won’t be easy, but it's a worthy goal to strive for to find peace, purpose, and belonging amongst each ourselves.
    The success with the Osage had been exhilarating, but now I felt adrift in a sea of questions. Did my actions truly matter? Was I merely playing a role assigned by fate or did I actually have control over my destiny? As a Cherokee, scattered across countless settlements after so much suffering at the hands of settlers, finding people who shared my heritage and culture seemed like an impossible dream.
Yet, there was also this nascent longing to create something new, something that transcended tribal boundaries and embraced all those who sought refuge from oppression. I knew I could never fully reconcile these conflicting desires – my desire for connection with my kin versus my yearning to forge a path forward. It felt like being torn between two worlds, belonging to neither but still searching for some semblance of wholeness within both. Ahuli leaned against the oak tree, feeling its rough bark beneath his fingertips. My home… it was once filled with laughter and music, stories whispered around the fire under a canopy of stars just like these ones. But that life was shattered by violence and displacement – stolen from me along with my family's ancestral lands. He looked at Biyogo and Rudy, who were both gazing into the flames. I want to honor our ancestors, but also build something lasting for future generations. Something more than just survival… a community where everyone feels safe, respected, and valued. But how do you create that when all around us is destruction and chaos?  Ahuli smiled faintly as he spoke. Biyogo’s longing for his heritage resonates with my own desire to reconnect with our people. And Rudy's yearning for a world where hard work is rewarded reminds me of the values we should strive to uphold. We may have different dreams, but we share a common bond – the pain of loss and the hope for something better.
Ahuli rose from his seat, extending his hand towards Biyogo and Rudy. Let us continue on this journey together, supporting each other as we navigate the challenges ahead. Perhaps by finding strength in unity, we can create our own version of home a place where belonging isn’t based on shared bloodlines or cultural traditions but simply on mutual respect and understanding. As they share a silent moment of connection, the embers of the campfire glow brighter, casting long shadows that dance with their dreams.
    The sun beat down mercilessly on the backs of the three boys as they crested the hill, revealing a small clearing nestled in the valley below. It was an unlikely sight – a cluster of rough-hewn cabins and log structures clinging to the slope like stubborn vines, smoke curling lazily from chimneys that seemed too large for their inhabitants' needs. This, according to the tattered map they’d traded a few trinkets for in the last town, was Tahlequah - an odd name for such a remote location, but it marked the first sign of civilization they'd seen in weeks.  "Looks like we finally hit something," Rudy said, wiping sweat from his brow with the back of his hand. "Not exactly a palace, though."
    Ahuli nodded, squinting at the settlement. “It’s… different,” he observed, his eyes scanning the mix of faces peering out from behind windows and doorways. There were men and women in worn clothing, some visibly nervous, others simply curious. A few wore buckskins or homespun fabrics, while still others sported hand-me-down clothes that suggested they'd been displaced like themselves.
Biyogo, ever cautious, kept his eyes darting between the villagers and the surrounding trees. "Keep an eye out," he murmured, adjusting the grip on his makeshift spear. "Frontier communities aren’t always welcoming."  As they descended into the valley, a handful of men emerged from one of the larger cabins to meet them. Their expressions were guarded but not hostile. One, who appeared older and more weathered than the others, stepped forward with a hesitant wave. He wore a faded blue shirt and patched trousers, his face etched with lines that spoke of hardship and resilience.  "Welcome," he said, his voice raspy from years spent battling the elements. "I'm Howard – leader of this here village." His eyes assessed them carefully, taking in their ragged appearance but also noting the alertness in their postures. “You boys look like you’ve seen better days.”  “We have,” Ahuli replied diplomatically, extending a hand. “I am Ahuli, and these are my companions, Rudy and Biyogo. We're looking for work."
    Howard nodded slowly. "Work there is, though it ain't easy. Planting time’s coming fast, so we need all hands on deck.” He gestured towards a barren field waiting for planting. “And some of our buildings are falling apart after last winter's storms. Repairs could use doing as well."  "We're strong and willing workers," Rudy chimed in, eager to prove himself useful. "Just point us where you need us most.”  Howard studied them for a moment longer before speaking. “Alright then. Come on with me. Let’s see what you can do.” He led them towards the potato field, introducing them to other villagers who were already laboring under the scorching sun. The work was grueling  hours spent bending over digging in the dirt, but it offered a sense of purpose that had been missing for so long.
    Over the next few days, they integrated themselves into the rhythms of Tahlequah . Rudy's knowledge of carpentry proved invaluable in repairing roofs and reinforcing walls. Biyogo’s sharp eyes helped spot hidden dangers – wild animals lurking near the edge of the settlement or suspicious strangers passing through. Ahuli, with his innate understanding of nature, assisted in finding clean water sources and identifying edible plants that supplemented their meager rations.  As they worked alongside the villagers, they began to form connections. They shared stories around evening campfires, listened to tales of hardship and triumph, and learned about the complex history of this mixed community – a melting pot of white settlers escaping financial ruin back east, displaced Native Americans forced from their ancestral lands by relentless expansion, and freed slaves seeking refuge from persecution.  One evening, while mending a fence with Howard, Rudy asked him about the village's origins. "How did so many different people end up here together?" he inquired, his voice filled with genuine curiosity.  Howard leaned against the post, chewing on a piece of dried meat. “Well,” he explained, “it started years ago when some folks fleeing the Panic of '37 stumbled upon this valley and found it fertile ground for farming.” He paused, spitting out a wad of tobacco juice. "Then came the Trail of Tears – many Cherokee and Creek people were forced to walk westward, seeking new homes away from their former lands. They sought refuge here, finding some measure of peace amongst themselves."  "And what about the freed slaves?" Ahuli asked, remembering Biyogo's experiences in escaping servitude.
    Howard nodded grimly. “They followed close behind, looking for a place where they could live without fear of being hunted like animals. This village became an unlikely sanctuary for all three groups - bound together by shared hardship and a desire to rebuild their lives.” He looked out over the gathering dusk, his expression softened with understanding. "We've learned to rely on each other, even when we disagree. It’s not always easy, but it beats being alone in this unforgiving world."  Biyogo, who had been listening intently, added, “It seems like everyone here has their own story of loss and resilience.” He looked at his two companions with a newfound sense of gratitude. "We may have lost our families and homes, but we've found something new - a community that accepts us for who we are."  As the days turned into weeks, they began to feel like they might finally belong somewhere. The work was hard, but it gave them purpose. The villagers welcomed them with cautious warmth, offering assistance when needed and sharing their meager resources without hesitation. They were no longer just three lost boys wandering through an uncertain landscape – they had found a place to call home, even if it wasn't exactly the life they’d once envisioned.
    One particularly beautiful evening, as they sat around a crackling fire with other villagers, Ahuli felt a sense of contentment wash over him that he hadn’t experienced in years. The smell of roasting meat filled the air, mingled with the sweet scent of wildflowers blooming nearby. Children ran and played amongst the adults, their laughter echoing through the valley.  "Look around," Rudy said, nudging Biyogo playfully. “We found this together.”   Biyogo smiled back, his eyes shining in the firelight. "It's not perfect," he agreed, "but it’s ours."  As the last vestiges of sunlight faded from the sky, a chilling realization settled upon Ahuli, Rudy and Biyogo. They had witnessed something truly terrible – a slaver caravan moving slowly along the ridge overlooking Hill Country Village, its wagons laden with at least six chained captives. The sight of these helpless individuals filled them with an overwhelming sense of horror and determination to take action.  Without hesitation, they moved swiftly towards each other, exchanging a silent nod that communicated volumes about their shared purpose. They knew that this was the moment for which they had been preparing – the opportunity to put everything they’d learned into practice and make a real difference in someone else's life. It wasn't just about rescuing these captives; it was about standing up against oppression and proving that even small acts of courage could have a profound impact on the world around them.
    Their planning session began immediately, their minds racing through every possibility as they sought to formulate a strategy that would maximize their chances of success while minimizing risk. They drew upon all their knowledge, experience, and skills, weaving together an intricate plan that relied on stealth, precision, and timing. Each man understood his role implicitly without the need for any explicit instructions – it was as if some invisible force had guided them to this point in time, preparing them perfectly for the challenge ahead.  Ahuli's familiarity with the surrounding terrain would be crucial in identifying weak spots in the caravan's defenses and guiding them towards optimal ambush locations. Rudy’s carpentry skills could be used to craft traps or obstacles that could slow down or disable the wagons if necessary. Biyogo, with his innate talent for stealth and infiltration, was ideally suited to slip through the ranks of the slavers undetected, potentially freeing some captives while creating chaos among their captors.  As darkness enveloped the hill country village, they observed from a distance as the slaver caravan made camp near a small stream just outside the village limits. The wagons were pulled into a circle for protection, and torches were lit to keep wild animals at bay. A few of the slavers sat around a crackling fire, sharpening their weapons while others kept watch over the captives who lay huddled together in despair. It was now or never; they needed to seize this opportunity before the sun rose again.  With newfound resolve, Ahuli, Rudy and Biyogo silently slipped away into the shadows, each one knowing exactly what he had to do without any need for further discussion. They were ready to face whatever lay ahead  confident in their abilities and united by a shared desire to bring justice to those who had been wronged.
    The air was thick with the smell of woodsmoke and sweat as darkness clung to the camp like a shroud. A single torch flickered, casting dancing shadows on the faces of the slumbering slavers. It was time. Ahuli, Rudy, and Biyogo moved with an almost supernatural grace, each playing their part in a meticulously planned sequence that could either succeed spectacularly or end in utter failure.  Rudy moved first.  The first step was to create a distraction. I spotted him – the largest of the guards, slumped against a wagon wheel, already well into his cups. He smelled strongly of cheap whiskey and stale meat. Perfect. I approached cautiously, feigning an innocent smile as I offered a friendly greeting in my most convincing Southern accent. “Evenin’, friend,” I drawled, extending a hand for a handshake. The guard grunted in response, his eyes bleary and unfocused.  “Mighty fine weather we’ve been havin’ lately, ain’t it?” I continued smoothly. "Good for crops, especially corn. Been plantin' some myself up north." This was my opening, a casual conversation about farming to keep him occupied while Ahuli worked her magic on the horses.  He mumbled something unintelligible before slurring, “Corn… yeah, good stuff.” He swayed precariously, almost falling off his perch. "You farm too, huh? What kind you grow?" My words were designed to maintain his attention and prevent him from noticing anything unusual happening around him.   “Mostly wheat and barley,” I replied casually, keeping my voice low but audible enough for him to hear. “Sometimes a little corn, though. Makes good grits when it’s cold.” The conversation flowed easily, each question leading to another, as the drunken guard rambled on about his own meager farming attempts in a distant land.  Ahuli was next with Rudy keeping the guard occupied, my attention shifted to his horse – a sturdy chestnut mare tethered nearby. Years of hunting had honed my senses and reflexes; I was able to approach silently, almost invisible against the backdrop of darkness and shadow. The horse whinnied softly as I drew near, but remained calm under my touch.  My fingers moved swiftly over its neck, locating the buckle that held the bridle in place. Then, with a practiced flick of the wrist, I unclipped it from its tether and gently guided the mare away from the main camp, deeper into the shadows where the light couldn’t reach. The horse seemed to understand my purpose, stepping silently alongside me as we made our way towards the nearby trees.
Reaching a secluded spot, I carefully removed the saddlebag from the mare's back, knowing that it held the keys  the very thing Rudy needed to distract the guard and give Biyogo his chance. The lock clicked open with ease as my fingers worked on the clasp, revealing a small pouch containing several keys of varying sizes.  One key in particular stood out - larger and more ornate than the rest. It had to be the one that unlocked those chains. I slipped it into my hand, feeling its weight against my palm. This was it – the final piece of the puzzle. Now all that remained was for me to pass the key to Biyogo to step up and finish what we'd started.
    My heart pounded in my chest as I approached the group of chained slaves huddled together under a meager blanket. They were small, emaciated figures, their faces etched with fear and exhaustion. I had spent years navigating these types of situations - blending into crowds, observing patterns, identifying vulnerabilities. This was what made me effective.  I took a deep breath and began speaking in hushed tones, using the local dialect that would resonate with them without raising any suspicion from the guards who were already asleep or passed out near their campfires. I spoke of hope – of freedom – and of an opportunity to escape into the safety of Indian Hills.  My words seemed to pierce through their despair as they looked at me with a glimmer of recognition in their eyes. They knew that if there was any chance for salvation, it lay within my hands. Reaching out, I gently touched one man's arm and whispered, “Trust me.” His gaze met mine, filled with both fear and determination.  Rudy signaled from across the camp - the key was in my hand a gift from Ahuli, A surge of adrenaline coursed through my veins as I began working on the first lock, using the ornate key to manipulate the tumblers within. The metal clicked softly but decisively, releasing one man’s shackles. Then another, and another. Soon, all six were free from their chains, blinking against the darkness like newborn babies.
I gestured for them to move silently towards Indian Hills, urging them on with whispered encouragement. They hesitated only briefly before disappearing into the dense undergrowth that surrounded the camp. As they vanished from sight, I felt a profound sense of satisfaction wash over me  a feeling far more potent than any victory I had ever known.
    Hours later, as the first rays of dawn pierced through the canopy of trees, the remaining slaver guards began stirring awake, their heads pounding with hangovers. They noticed something amiss - empty chains dangling from the wagon wheels where the captives should have been. Confusion and panic quickly spread throughout the group as they realized what had happened someone had broken into their camp and freed the slaves in the dead of night.  Their attempts to track down the escapees proved futile, as those who fled were skilled in survival techniques passed down through generations of indigenous peoples. The villagers watched from afar, silently supporting the liberation that took place without ever revealing their involvement. They knew that by helping these people find freedom, they were contributing to a larger cause – one that would ultimately lead to a more just and equitable world for all.
    Rudy, Ahuli, and Biyogo had succeeded in their mission,but not without facing immense risk and danger along the way. However, they emerged from this experience stronger and more determined than ever before. They were now symbols of hope for others who yearned for freedom – proof that even the smallest among us can make a difference when we work together towards a common goal.
    The dust settled over the departing slavers like a shroud. They were gone vanished into the wilderness with curses and threats echoing behind them, unable to pinpoint where their captives had disappeared or how they’d been liberated. The frustration hung heavy in the air, thick enough to taste. But it didn't linger long. As soon as the last wagon rumbled away, a different kind of energy filled the small valley – an openness, a warmth that radiated from every corner of the village. The three boys - Rudy, Ahuli and Biyogo - stood at the edge of town, watching the departing figures with cautious eyes. They'd grown accustomed to suspicion, to being treated as outsiders, but this was something new entirely – an invitation into belonging. Hesitantly, they stepped forward, drawn by the welcoming smiles and outstretched hands that greeted them. It felt surreal, like stepping from a harsh desert landscape into an oasis of tranquility. The villagers were quick to offer assistance, providing food, shelter and clothes without hesitation. There was no demand for repayment or servitude; just genuine kindness and acceptance. Rudy, ever pragmatic, found himself drawn to the fields where he could put his knowledge of farming to good use. He worked alongside seasoned farmers, learning new techniques and sharing what little experience he had gained from previous hardships. The feel of rich soil between his fingers, the satisfaction of planting seeds with purpose – it was a grounding force that soothed the anxieties still lingering in his mind.
    Ahuli, with his keen eyes and innate understanding of tracking, naturally gravitated towards scouting and hunting for the village. He knew how to read signs on trees, follow animal trails, identify edible plants - skills honed during years spent navigating the wilderness alone. The villagers recognized his talent immediately and welcomed him into their ranks as an invaluable asset. Hunting was no longer a matter of survival; it became a duty, a contribution that earned him respect and admiration within the community. Biyogo’s strength and gentle nature made him ideal for working with the livestock. He had always possessed a quiet empathy for animals, understanding their needs without needing words. The villagers, mostly farmers who relied on their livestock for sustenance, were delighted to have Biyogo assist in managing the herd - ensuring they were well-fed, protected from predators and treated with kindness.
    As days turned into weeks, the boys’ initial apprehension began to fade, replaced by a burgeoning sense of belonging. They had found something more than just acceptance – they had discovered a home, a place where they could contribute their skills, share their experiences, and be valued for who they were. The scars of their past remained, but slowly, those wounds started to heal in the warmth of this new community. The rhythm of village life became familiar, comforting - rising with the sun, working alongside neighbors, sharing meals around crackling fires under starry skies. They learned about the local customs, participated in seasonal festivals, and even began picking up fragments of the village’s unique dialect. Each small step solidified their integration into this new family. Rudy found himself laughing more often than he remembered ever doing before - genuinely happy moments shared with newfound friends, a stark contrast to the constant vigilance that had defined much of his life. He missed nothing from his previous life, except perhaps the memory of his mother's loving embrace - something which was now replaced by the warmth and support of this welcoming community.
    Ahuli relished the independence he felt in his role as scout and hunter. He no longer needed to worry about finding food or shelter; instead, his skills were appreciated and rewarded. His sharp eyes and quiet movements served not only to protect the village but also allowed her a sense of purpose that had eluded him for years. Biyogo, with his gentle hands and calm demeanor, thrived in his role caring for the livestock. He found solace in their companionship, finding an unspoken understanding between him and each animal he tended. His kindness was reciprocated by the animals’ trust and affection - a bond that made him feel truly valued. One evening, as they sat around a bonfire with the villagers, sharing stories and laughter, Rudy spoke up “I never thought I would find a place like this.” Ahuli nodded in agreement, adding, "It's been more than just acceptance; it's about finding ourselves again." Biyogo smiled softly, stating simply, "We are home now.”
    The fire crackled and popped as if in approval. The villagers leaned closer, offering smiles of encouragement and gratitude for the contributions each boy had made to their community. It was a moment of quiet contentment, an unspoken understanding that they were all bound together by something more profound than mere circumstance – it was a shared journey towards healing, belonging, and finding home. The sense of peace settled over them like a soft blanket - a testament to the resilience of the human spirit and its capacity for renewal even in the face of adversity. They had faced hardship, endured suffering, but ultimately found refuge and solace within this extraordinary community. It was not merely an ending; it was a beginning – a chance to build new lives, forge lasting friendships, and embrace the joy of being part of something truly special. And as they gazed into the flickering flames, they knew that their journey had finally come full circle - finding home in the most unexpected place.
    The late afternoon sun cast long shadows across Tahlequah’s dusty main street, baking the weathered wood of its buildings a warm amber hue. A relentless wind whipped through the cracks in the aging structures, carrying with it the scent of pine and dry earth – familiar comforts to those who called this small village home. Rudy stopped outside the general store/post office, its bell tinkling merrily as he pushed open the door. The interior smelled of molasses and fresh-baked bread, a welcome reprieve from the dusty exterior. A young woman, no older than himself, stood behind the counter, her dark hair pulled back in a simple braid that fell down her neck. Her eyes, the color of storm clouds, held an unusual intensity as she sorted through a pile of letters, a small frown etched onto her face. The store was filled with the usual assortment of goods bolts of fabric, stacks of canned peaches and beans, and rows upon rows of dusty books that lined one wall. A few locals browsed amongst the shelves, their faces worn but content as they went about their daily routines. “Can I help you find something?” she asked, her voice surprisingly gentle despite her stern expression. Rudy hesitated before answering, unsure how to approach this woman who seemed so independent and capable. “Just looking around,” he replied finally, keeping his tone casual. She nodded slowly, returning to her task without further comment. Rudy wandered over to a display of canned goods, running his fingers along the labels as if searching for something familiar in their mundane uniformity. The silence between them stretched out, thick with unspoken tension and awkwardness that hung heavy in the air. He noticed an old photograph tucked behind one of the jars a faded image of men wearing Confederate uniforms, their faces grimly determined as they stared into the camera. “Your father… he fought at Pea Ridge, didn’t he?” he asked suddenly, breaking the silence with unexpected directness. Becky froze, startled by his knowledge of her family history. “Yes,” she admitted, feeling a sudden flush creep up his neck. she braced himself for judgment or criticism from someone who had also lost a loved one in that infamous battle. She studied him intently for a moment before speaking again, her voice softening slightly. “I’m Becky,” she said, extending a hand across the counter. He took it in hers, feeling the warmth and strength radiating from her grasp. “And I run this place.” It became clear to him then that she was more than just a shopkeeper; she was the backbone of this community, holding everything together with quiet determination and resilience.
    As they talked, Rudy learned that Becky's mother was chronically ill and unable to work, leaving her responsible for managing the store and providing for their family. Her strength and resourcefulness were truly admirable – qualities he could only dream of possessing at his own age. He couldn’t help but feel drawn to this young woman who seemed both vulnerable and fiercely independent, a kindred spirit in a world that had dealt them both a cruel hand. The awkwardness began to dissipate as the conversation flowed more naturally between them, filled with shared stories of loss, resilience, and hope for the future. They spoke about their families, their dreams, and the challenges they faced in this small corner of Oklahoma territory. It was an unlikely connection forged through mutual pain and understanding – a friendship that blossomed amidst the ruins of war and hardship.
By the time Rudy prepared to leave, he had gained more than just new acquaintances; he’d found someone who truly understood his burdens and shared his spirit. The lingering sadness in Becky’s eyes hadn't vanished entirely but was now softened by a glimmer of hope - a sign that even after all they'd been through, there was still the possibility of finding solace and connection with others along life’s difficult path.
    The rhythmic clatter of hooves on dirt filled the air, a familiar symphony to Ahuli’s ears. He sat perched atop a weathered fence post near the general store/post office in Tahlequah, watching with quiet amusement as Rudy and Becky interacted. It had been only weeks since their first meeting, yet a palpable shift had occurred between them. Their conversations were now filled with laughter and playful banter, punctuated by stolen glances that spoke volumes about the deepening affection they held for one another. Ahuli was struck by how naturally it all unfolded - there was no grand gesture or dramatic declaration of love, just an understated tenderness that bloomed organically in their daily interactions. He observed them assisting elderly customers together, sharing stories with local children, and working side-by-side to maintain the store's operations. They moved as one, a testament to the burgeoning connection between them – two individuals finding solace and strength in each other’s company amidst a landscape of uncertainty and hardship. The bond between Rudy, Becky, and Ahuli had also strengthened over time. Their presence was increasingly valued within the community, their efforts contributing significantly to the village's well-being. People sought out their counsel on matters both big and small, recognizing them as reliable pillars of support in a challenging environment. Even Biyogo, who often retreated into his own world of dreams and aspirations, seemed invigorated by this newfound sense of belonging. One evening, while sharing supper around a crackling campfire outside the store, Ahuli noticed Biyogo gazing out at the distant hills with an almost wistful expression in his eyes. "I've been thinking," Biyogo began, breaking the comfortable silence that had settled over them, "that there’s more to life than just surviving here." He spoke of traveling west, seeking opportunities for prosperity and a chance to forge his own destiny beyond the confines of their small village. The idea resonated with Ahuli - a flicker of hope ignited within him as he realized that escaping the shadows of the past might not be impossible after all. Driven by this newfound inspiration, Ahuli embarked on a personal journey of discovery. He began searching for any trace of his scattered Cherokee relatives who had been forcibly removed from their ancestral lands years ago during the Trail of Tears. The quest proved challenging but also deeply fulfilling – each small clue he uncovered brought him closer to reconnecting with those lost members of his heritage. Despite these individual pursuits, the sense of family among the three remained unshaken. They supported one another’s endeavors wholeheartedly, recognizing that their strength lay in their unity and shared resilience. As they huddled together under a canopy of stars, Ahuli couldn't help but feel grateful for the friendships he had forged in this unlikely place – bonds that transcended circumstance and provided him with an unwavering sense of belonging amidst the trials and tribulations of life.
    The scent of woodsmoke and roasting meat hung heavy in the air, a comforting aroma that permeated every corner of Tahlequah. It was a celebratory occasion – Rudy and Becky were to be wed, their engagement announcement sending ripples of excitement through the small community. But beneath the joyous atmosphere lay an underlying current of melancholy, for it marked not only a union of two hearts but also the imminent departure of those closest to Ahuli his chosen brothers, Biyogo and Rudy. Ahuli leaned against the sturdy oak post supporting the porch roof of the general store/post office, watching with a mixture of pride and sadness as preparations for the wedding reached their peak. The setting sun cast long shadows across the gathering crowd, illuminating faces both familiar and new. He could see his own reflection in the polished glass windows of the store, older now than when he first arrived in this remote corner of the indian hills. Much had changed – he’d found a home amongst these people, built bonds of friendship that transcended blood ties, yet now, it seemed, fate was pulling them apart once more.
    Rudy emerged from the store, his arm draped possessively around Becky's waist. She wore a simple but elegant dress crafted from homespun cloth, adorned with wildflowers woven through her dark hair. They paused before Ahuli, their smiles radiant despite the unspoken emotions swirling beneath the surface. “Well, old friend,” Rudy said, extending a hand in camaraderie, “it looks like we’re finally doing this right.” He chuckled softly, his voice filled with genuine happiness and affection for Becky. "Couldn't ask for a better life partner, could I?" Becky squeezed his arm affectionately. "Not at all, dear Rudy," she replied, her eyes sparkling with love. “We couldn’t have done it without you two.” She glanced towards Biyogo, who was leaning against the fence line, observing the scene with a quiet intensity that Ahuli knew well. Biyogo nodded in acknowledgment. "It's been an honor to be part of this journey," he said, his voice low but sincere. He met Becky’s gaze and added, “Thank you for believing in me.” Becky reached into her pocket and produced a small pouch filled with coins. “These are from the store profits,” she explained. "I've saved enough to cover your stagecoach fare all the way out west – to California." She offered it to Biyogo, who accepted the gift with a grateful bow of his head. “You’re too kind," he responded, clutching the pouch tightly in his hand. A flicker of determination ignited within him as he envisioned the vast expanse of possibilities that awaited him beyond those distant hills. "I won't forget this." The weight of the moment settled upon Ahuli like a palpable force. He knew that Biyogo’s departure would leave an immense void in their lives, but he also understood that it was his right to pursue his dreams and seek fortune elsewhere. It mirrored Ahuli’s own recent discovery – a small group of Cherokee relatives residing deeper within the hills, clinging to fragments of their lost heritage.
    “It seems like we all have our paths to follow,” Ahuli said, breaking the silence that had fallen over them. His voice was filled with a mix of resignation and acceptance. "We've shared so much in this place. I won’t forget any of it.”
Rudy stepped forward and clasped Ahuli's shoulder firmly. “You know you always have a home here, brother," he said, his eyes shining with warmth. "This community will be forever grateful for everything you’ve done." Ahuli reciprocated the gesture, feeling a surge of emotion well up within him as he realized how deeply connected they truly were. They had forged a bond that transcended bloodlines and cultural differences – a brotherhood built on mutual respect, loyalty, and unwavering support. The thought of parting ways with these two men brought tears to his eyes, but he knew it was time for each of them to embark on their individual journeys.
    As the wedding celebration commenced in full swing, Ahuli realized that this joyous occasion had inadvertently become a farewell party. Laughter filled the air as guests danced and feasted under the twinkling lights strung between buildings. But amidst the revelry, Ahuli couldn’t shake off the sense of finality that hung heavy over everything. He watched Biyogo exchange farewells with Becky, his silhouette fading into the night sky as he prepared to board the stagecoach bound for California. The moment arrived when it was time for Rudy and Becky to leave. They embraced each other tightly, their faces radiant with happiness but also tinged with a subtle sadness. As they climbed into the waiting carriage, Ahuli felt a pang of regret that this chapter in his life was drawing to an end. But he knew that their friendship would endure despite the distance, and that their memories together would forever be etched within his heart. With one final wave, Rudy and Becky were gone, swallowed by the darkness as they retired to the Tahlequah’s general store’s upstairs apartment. Ahuli stood there for a long while longer, watching as the stagecoach disappeared into the night. He turned towards Biyogo's direction, hoping to catch one last glimpse of him before he vanished completely from his life. But all that remained was an empty space on the fence line, a silent reminder of the brotherly bond they had shared in this remote corner of the indian hills. He took a deep breath and turned back towards the hills, knowing that it was time for him to move onward as well to find those lost Cherokee relatives and begin anew, carrying the lessons he'd learned and the memories he’d made with his chosen family within his heart.

EPILOGUE One Year Later

    The midday sun cast long shadows across “Becky’s Mercantile,” a well-worn yet inviting storefront that housed the fledging post office nestled in the heart of Tahlequah, Indian Territory. Inside, the aroma of freshly baked apple pie mingled with the earthy scent of dried herbs and spices, creating an atmosphere that welcomed weary travelers and local townsfolk alike. Rudy, his hands calloused but gentle, meticulously wiped down a counter while Becky, her face etched with both grief and determination, sorted through bolts of fabric behind the display window. They were husband and wife now – bound together by shared adversity and an enduring love for one another. The recent loss of Becky’s mother had cast a pall over their lives but they pressed on, leaning into each other for strength as they navigated this new chapter.
    Ahuli, a young Cherokee man barely eighteen years old, browsed the shelves filled with supplies he needed for his small hunting lodge just outside town. He was more than a customer to Becky and Rudy; he was family - a loyal friend forged in the crucible of war. A shared experience had cemented their bond escaping the chaotic battlefield of Pea Ridge alongside each other as they fled Arkansas, finding solace and friendship amidst the chaos. The three of them were like family now united by circumstance and unwavering support for one another. As Ahuli selected a roll of twine, a young boy burst through the door, panting heavily. “Mail delivery!” he exclaimed, thrusting an canvas bag into Becky's hands. It was filled with mail for the tiny community and deep in the bottome Becky found a letter addressed in elegant script to Rudolph McKinney,from a "Mr. B. Roscoe" – a name unfamiliar to Becky,but immediately recognized by Rudy. There was a return address of El Monte,Cal., an air of mystery surrounded its sudden arrival.
    Becky turned towards her husband and their close friend, holding out the letter with curiosity. “Seems like we have a letter,” she said softly, gesturing for them to join her behind the counter. The three gathered around a small table draped with a faded floral cloth, the only light coming from a flickering kerosene lamp hanging above. Rudy leaned in, examining the envelope closely. "Never heard of anyone by that name," he muttered, scratching his head thoughtfully. He glanced at Becky and then at Ahuli, their eyes meeting in silent communication as they shared an unspoken question was this their friend and companion they had waved farewell to as he left on the stage? His name was Biyago,but who was Roscoe? The three friends huddled together, their faces illuminated by the dim light, as they cautiously unfolded the letter. The elegant script revealed a tale of hardship and resilience, penned by a man named Biyago Roscoe who had shared the three boys escape from the hell of Pea Ridge. As they absorbed the contents of the letter, a sense of wonder and connection filled the small store. Its seems that beauracacy dictated that Biyago had to take a second name, and he had chosen his old slave name of Roscoe,as the letter ended in a finly scripted signature, Mr.Biyago Roscoe.
