The Cazique
by Norsiwel


The sizzle of the flat-top grill and a tinny Big Band rendition of "Fly Me to the Moon" formed a strangely mundane soundscape for Felix's audacious schemes. Unruly sun-blonde curls crowned his freckled face as he devoured "The Art of the Con," its pages dog-eared, each underlined passage whispering forgotten street smarts of   New York City.  Outside, the relentless urban ballet unfolded; suited businessmen weaving through harried tourists; sirens singing their discordant opera. An abrupt shuffle from the corner booth caught his eye. A portly, distinguished gentleman,a rolled newspaper held precariously in one hand, lumbered towards the restrooms, a half-finished tray of McNuggets and a large Coke abandoned on the Formica tabletop. Impatience prickled Felix's temples, mimicking the city's frenetic pulse; his stomach rumbled in time with it an insistent second-act orchestra demanding its due. In the fleeting seconds the old man was out of sight, Felix sprang up. He executed a practiced ballet of consumption; McNuggets vanished, one by one, followed by a defiant glug of lukewarm soda. A practiced flick of his napkin disguised the transgression before he melted back into the throng, disappearing through the discreet side exit with practiced anonymity. His heart hammered against his ribs, a staccato rhythm that spoke less of fear and more of exhilaration. 

Felix paused outside, hands shoved deep in his threadbare parka pockets. He couldn't go home Mrs. Garugin would certainly buttonhole him for the back rent on his dingy room, that woman had eyes in the back of her head.  If only he could make deals like the author of his book, he sighed and decided that school was probably the safest place now that he'd staved off his hunger.

Professor Smithers' Economics 101 lecture hall buzzed with pre-class chaos, backpacks thudding onto desks, phones chiming their digital symphony, someone's energy drink hissing open like a tiny carbonated grenade. Felix slipped through the back entrance, "The Art of the Con" tucked under one arm like contraband scripture, ready to blend into the anonymous masses of undergrad anonymity.

Then he saw the suit.

Trench coat. Cheap leather briefcase. That particular brand of patient stillness that screamed process server. The man stood by the lecturer's podium, scanning faces with the methodical attention of someone who'd memorized a photograph. Felix's stomach; so recently satisfied by purloined McNuggets,clenched into a fist.

"Looking for a Felix Bumgartner," the suit announced to Professor Smithers, voice carrying across the tiered seating. "Important legal documents."

Felix executed a smooth about-face, his practiced street-ballet autopilot kicking in. Don't run. Running attracts attention. Just... relocate with purpose. He merged into a cluster of students heading toward the science wing, The Art of the Con pressed against his ribs like a talisman.

Behind him "Hey! You there; blonde kid!"

Under his breath,”Shit.”  Autopilot abandoned. Felix ran.

Through the commons (scattering protesters, coffee cart), down the admin corridor, and straight into the gleaming halls of the Kensington Research Complex. Chrome and glass and that peculiar sterile smell of academic money at work.

The process server's footsteps echoed behind him, leather soles slapping concrete with metronomic determination.

Felix wrenched open the first unlabeled door he found. A laboratory materialized around him; benches cluttered with equipment that looked equal parts science fiction and garage sale, cables snaking across floors, something that might have been a miniature particle accelerator humming with barely contained energy. Best of all a coat rack festooned with white lab coats like surrendered flags.

He grabbed one, shrugged it on. The sleeves hung past his fingertips. He rolled them up with shaking hands, then grabbed a clipboard from the nearest bench and stared at it with feigned intensity. Just another grad student. Nothing to see here.

The door burst open.

The process server stood silhouetted in the doorway, breathing hard, scanning the lab. His gaze swept past Felix once, twice; then locked on. Recognition flared in those professional eyes.  "Nice try, kid."  Felix backed away, clipboard raised like a shield. "I think you've got the wrong—"

His heel caught something. A cable? A tripod leg? The world lurched sideways. Felix stumbled backward, arms windmilling, and walked straight into what felt like falling through a waterfall made of static electricity and angry bees and his grandmother's old TV when the cable went out.

Reality hiccupped.

The smell hit first.

Not the antiseptic sterility of the lab, but something organic and immediate; coal smoke, sweat, cheap perfume, tobacco, the ghost of chamber pots imperfectly emptied, all of it stewing in closed quarters. Felix's sinuses revolted. His eyes watered.

He stood in a room. Not the lab. A room. Crimson wallpaper peeling at the corners, gaslights flickering (gaslights?), heavy curtains blocking what might have been windows. A four-poster bed dominated the space, its sheets tangled and recently abandoned. Women's laughter echoed from somewhere below, accompanied by a piano playing something jaunty and off-key.

"What the actual—"  A pile of clothes lay on a chair by the door. Not discarded. Arranged,neatly. Coat, vest, trousers, all neatly folded. A gentleman's outfit, though "gentleman" seemed a generous interpretation given the venue.

Felix's street smarts whispered urgent calculations: wherever he was, however he'd gotten here (drugs? Concussion? Nervous breakdown?), standing around gaping was a luxury he couldn't afford. The process server might come through that door any second. Or the room's actual occupant. Or, who knows?

Papers peeked from the coat's inner pocket.  Felix grabbed them. An invitation, cream-colored cardstock, embossed with someone's family crest;

Lord and Lady Pemberton request the pleasure of Mr. Gregor MacGregor's company for tea, today at four o'clock, to discuss the promising opportunities in Poyais.

Poyais? Felix's brow furrowed. Some kind of investment scheme? And tea meant food. His stomach, that reliable traitor, rumbled its approval.

The coat's other pockets yielded better treasures, coins (weird coins, heavy and golden), folded banknotes (even weirder; hand-engraved, dates he couldn't quite read in the dim light), and a pocket watch that ticked with mechanical precision.

From below he heard footsteps on stairs. Heavy. Masculine. Approaching.

Felix's hands moved on autopilot, executing the quick-change he'd perfected in department store dressing rooms and gym locker rooms and that one memorable night fleeing an angry ex's apartment. Off with the ridiculous lab coat. Strip down to his t-shirt and jeans. Then the transformation: linen shirt (scratchy), vest (tight across his shoulders), trousers (too long, he had to roll the cuffs), coat (surprisingly good fit), and finally the pocket watch tucked into the vest pocket with what he hoped looked like casual ownership.

His own clothes; 21st-century wal-mart evidence; he stuffed under the bed. "The Art of the Con" folded inside his lightweight backpack went into the coat's deep inner pocket, its familiar weight a small comfort.

Then footsteps stopped outside the door.

Felix grabbed the invitation, forced his breathing to slow, and channeled every ounce of fake-it-till-you-make-it confidence The Art of the Con had preached. Chapter Three; Own the Room Before the Room Owns You.  The door opened.

A portly man in shirtsleeves stood there, face flushed, suspenders hanging loose. His eyes went wide. "MacGregor? Thought you'd left already."

Felix's smile came smooth as butter. "Just collecting my things. Appointment to keep."

He descended stairs into organized chaos; a parlor full of women in various states of undress, men in various states of inebriation, and a piano player who'd clearly given up on melody in favor of volume. No one looked twice at him. Just another gentleman making his exit.

Felix pushed through the front door into; a different world. Daylight. Cobblestone street. Horse-drawn carriages. Women in bonnets and long skirts. Men in top hats. Buildings that looked like they'd stepped out of a Dickens novel, because they had, because this was; "Oh," Felix whispered, invitation crinkling in his suddenly nerveless fingers. "Oh, shit."

London,1820

Lord Pemberton's address was printed right there at the bottom. And tea started at four. And Felix Bumgartner no, Gregor MacGregor now; had nowhere else to go but forward.

He checked the pocket watch. Half past three.

Time to see what The Art of the Con could do in an era that hadn't invented fact-checking yet.

The Pemberton townhouse announced its wealth before Felix crossed the threshold; white stone facade, brass fixtures polished to mirrorlike shine, a doorman whose livery probably cost more than Felix's entire wardrobe back home. Back in 2020. Back when "home" meant something.

He clutched the invitation like a passport, its embossed crest catching the afternoon light.

The butler; silver-haired, ramrod posture, expression suggesting he'd sucked a lemon sometime in 1805 and never recovered; accepted the card with two fingers. "The Cazique of Poyais," he intoned, as if announcing the Second Coming. "Mr. Gregor MacGregor."

The drawing room beyond could have housed Felix's old apartment three times over. Afternoon sun slanted through tall windows, illuminating perhaps a dozen people arranged on furniture that looked like it cost more than most people earned in a year. The men wore tailcoats, cravats, mutton-chop sideburns that defied both gravity and good sense. The women boasted gowns with more fabric than Felix had owned in his entire life, jewelry that caught light like tiny imprisoned suns.

"MacGregor!" Lord Pemberton extracted himself from a cluster of men, hand extended. Portly, prosperous, with the kind of confidence that came from never having stolen McNuggets to survive. "Delighted you could join us. Lady Pemberton, may I present the Cazique of Poyais?"

Felix executed what he hoped resembled a bow, his threadbare memories of period dramas doing heavy lifting. "Your Lordship. Lady Pemberton." He let his natural accent carry; American filtered through exhaustion, trusting his Scottish cover story. "Ye're too kind to receive me."

"Nonsense!" Pemberton steered him toward the food with the enthusiasm of a man presenting the Crown Jewels. "We're fascinated by your venture. Do help yourself you must be famished from your voyage."

Voyage. Right. Felix had supposedly arrived on a sugar shipment from his home in Poyais. He grabbed a sandwich; cucumber, blessedly simple, and managed not to shove the entire thing in his mouth at once. Chew. Swallow. Project calm.

"Mr. MacGregor," a thin gentleman with spectacular whiskers leaned forward, "Lord Pemberton mentioned sugar plantations?"

Felix swallowed. Reached for another sandwich while his brain scrambled. Sugar. Sugar was valuable. Sugar plantations were... big? "Aye," he heard himself say. "Extensive cultivation. The soil in Poyais is wonderful" where the hell was Poyais supposed to be? " along the Mosquito Coast, ye ken, it's remarkably suited."

Every eye in the room locked onto him. Felix took another bite, playing for time. The Art of the Con, Chapter Four; Confidence sells. Hesitation kills.

"The climate?" someone asked. "Tropical." Felix grabbed a scone, his hunger warring with his need to keep talking. "Hot. Ideal growing season nearly year-round." That seemed right. Tropical meant hot, hot meant growing things. He was basically describing every banana he'd ever stolen from that cart on 34th Street.

"And the labor situation?" A woman this time, sharp-eyed, intelligent. Dangerous.

Felix's mind raced. Labor. Plantations. 1820. Oh. Slavery. His stomach churned but he kept his face neutral. "We're... developing local arrangements." Vague. Stay vague. "The native population has proven quite" what would they want to hear? "amenable to commerce."  Nods around the room. He'd apparently said something right.

"I understand you also cultivate bananas?" Lord Pemberton pressed, and Felix nearly choked on his scone.  Bananas. Those yellow things he'd shoplifted when desperate enough. "Oh aye," he managed. "Extensive groves. The banana trade to Europe is problematic due to spoilage currently" did they even have banana trade? "but it is just beginning to develop. Poyais is positioned to dominate the market."

He was making this up wholesale, but their faces... they believed him. Every word.
A gentleman in an elaborate waistcoat leaned forward. "And the land grants you mentioned in your correspondence"

Correspondence?  Felix hadn't written any correspondence. The real MacGregor must have. He pivoted. "Aye, prime acreage available. Various parcels, surveyed and documented." Were they surveyed? Didn't matter. "From coastal plantation sites to interior holdings."

"At what terms?"  Felix drew a blank. The Art of the Con whispered guidance; Price it high enough to seem valuable, low enough to feel accessible. "Varies by location and acreage. I'd need to consult my documentation" documentation he didn't have "but rest assured, early investors will receive the most favorable considerations."

The room practically hummed with interest. Felix kept eating, kept talking, his 2020 street-vendor knowledge of tropical agriculture somehow passing for expertise. Sugar. Bananas. Hot weather. Good soil. He was literally describing a grocery store produce section and they were scribbling notes.

Lord Pemberton pulled him aside as the conversation fragmented into excited speculation. "MacGregor, I want in on the ground floor." He pressed something into Felix's hand; folded banknotes, heavy with promise. "Consider this a gesture of good faith. One hundred pounds. I'll want documentation, of course, but I trust we can formalize arrangements shortly?"

One hundred pounds. Felix's fingers closed around the money, his face maintaining what he hoped was aristocratic composure while his brain screamed holy shit holy shit holy shit.

"Of course, your Lordship. I'll have proper documentation prepared within the week."

He stayed another twenty minutes, fielding questions, consuming sandwiches, accidentally selling a fictional country to people who couldn't verify a single claim. When he finally extracted himself; prior engagement, terribly sorry, crucial meeting with his solicitor, he walked out with a full stomach, a pocket heavy with cash, and the dawning realization that he'd just done something either brilliant or catastrophically stupid. Probably both.

The door closed behind him. London's afternoon chaos enveloped him; horses, carriages, street vendors crying their wares. Felix pulled out the banknotes, counted them in disbelief. One hundred pounds.  For talking about bananas he'd stolen and sugar he'd only ever seen in packets.

The Art of the Con pressed against his ribs through the coat pocket. Once you're in, go all in. Felix looked back at the Pemberton townhouse, then at the money in his hands.  He’d better find a hotel, a nice one.

And a flag. Countries had flags, right? And he wondered what was a Cazique?

The suite at the Regency Hotel announced wealth with the subtlety of a cathedral bell: silk wallpaper in deep crimson, furniture that looked like it had witnessed the signing of important treaties, a four-poster bed large enough to house a small family. Felix stood in the center of it all, coat draped over a chair, "The Art of the Con" open on the escritoire beside a stack of foolscap he'd convinced the concierge to provide.  "Compliments of the management, sir," the man had said, practically genuflecting. "And if I might be so bold" He'd pressed five pounds into Felix's hand, notes folded with the reverence usually reserved for religious texts. "A small investment. In Poyais. Everyone's talking about it, sir. Everyone."
That had been two hours ago. Felix still felt the weight of those words. Everyone's talking about it.

The Times lay spread across the ottoman, damning in its enthusiasm; THE UNKNOWN LANDS OF THE NEW WORLD London finds itself fortunate to host a most distinguished guest this season. Mr. Gregor MacGregor, styling himself the Cazique of Poyais, brings firsthand knowledge of territories along the Mosquito Coast heretofore known only through the vaguest accounts. His descriptions of extensive sugar cultivation, banana groves of remarkable productivity, and; most tantalizing, promising gold deposits in the interior regions, have captured the imagination of investors and natural philosophers alike.

The Cazique himself wore a striking example of Poyaisian craftsmanship during his appearance at Lord Pemberton's residence; a gold chain of unusual workmanship and evident purity. When this correspondent inquired about the piece, Mr. MacGregor confirmed it originated from native mines, demonstrating the quality of ore available… Felix's hand went unconsciously to his neck. The chain; his stupid $20 Canal Street bling with its chunky links and faux-gold plating, suddenly felt like an albatross. They'd examined it at the tea. Lord Pemberton's friend, Sir William something-or-other, had actually asked to bite it. Felix had nearly choked on his scone watching the man's teeth sink into aluminum plating, seeing his eyes widen with approval.

"Remarkably soft," Sir William had pronounced. "High-grade ore, clearly. And the craftsmanship! I've never seen work quite like it."
Because it was machine-stamped in a factory that wouldn't exist for two centuries, Felix thought now, staring at the newspaper. Because it's fake. Because everything about this is fake except the very real money accumulating in his pockets and the very real invitations piling up on the side table.  Seventeen of them. He'd counted twice.

The Duke of Manchester requests... Lady Ashworth would be delighted... The Royal Geographic Society extends… Felix grabbed his threadbare backpack from where he'd shoved it under the bed; the last physical connection to 2020, to McNuggets and credit card debt and a life that seemed simultaneously five minutes and five centuries ago. He dumped the contents across the bed; modern wallet (useless), dead phone (useless), half-empty pack of gum (possibly useful?), that ratty paperback of The Art of the Con he'd been reading in the lab had already integrated into his coat pocket, and A banana-scented air freshener. One of those little cardboard tree things that had been hanging from his backpack's zipper. He'd forgotten it was even there.

Felix stared at it. Turned it over. Smelled it; that aggressive, chemical approximation of banana that always smelled more like candy than fruit was still strong.  An idea formed, terrible and brilliant in equal measure.
He consulted the book, flipping to Chapter Eight; Props Sell Reality.

The human mind craves tangible proof. Abstract promises fade; physical evidence lingers. A contract, a sample, a photograph. Anything the mark can touch, smell, or see transforms speculation into certainty. The con succeeds not when they believe your words, but when they trust their own senses.  Felix looked from the book to the air freshener to the foolscap spread across the desk.

"Right then," he said to the empty room. "Time to make a country."  The next three hours vanished into creation. Felix had never considered himself artistic,his handwriting barely qualified as legible; but desperation bred innovation. He sketched maps first, pulling from half-remembered geography lessons and that one time he'd looked at a Central American atlas while very stoned. The Mosquito Coast was... somewhere along Nicaragua? Honduras? He drew coastline, added rivers (rivers seemed tropical), marked an inlet he labeled "Port Poyais" in his best approximation of calligraphy.

Interior regions received careful attention; "Sugar Plantations" here, "Banana Groves" there, and because apparently he'd promised it "Gold Mining District" in the vaguely mountainous squiggles he added inland. He included a scale (completely made up), a compass rose (crooked but present), and a legend explaining various symbols he'd invented on the spot.

It looked ridiculous. It looked official. He couldn't tell the difference anymore.
Currency came next. Felix pulled out a pound note, studied its elaborate engraving, its promises of redemption, its air of institutional authority. Then he started drawing. The "Poyais Dollar" emerged in careful pen strokes, a denomination system based on his Econ 101 understanding (ones, fives, tens, twenties; familiar, trustworthy), elaborate borders he copied from the British note, and in the center, a palm tree over crossed machetes because that seemed tropical and vaguely governmental.

A flag design followed-horizontal stripes (blue for water, white for... purity? Sure.), a yellow sun in the corner (tropical optimism), and that same palm-tree-and-machetes emblem because brand consistency mattered. The Art of the Con, Chapter Twelve; Repetition builds recognition.
He was sketching land certificates; elaborate affairs with spaces for acreage, location, and buyer's name,when someone knocked.  Felix's heart executed a complicated maneuver involving his throat. "Yes?"  "Message for you, sir." A hotel porter's voice, muffled through oak.

Felix gathered the documents, shoved them in the escritoire drawer, and opened the door. The porter offered an envelope on a silver tray, eyes studiously avoiding direct contact as if Felix might accidentally bestow tropical wealth through eye contact alone. "Thank you." Felix fumbled for a coin,found a shilling among the change; and overpaid spectacularly based on the porter's expression.

The envelope bore an embossed seal; Admiral Sir Charles Richardson, Ret. Inside, elegant script delivered a polite apocalypse.  Mr. MacGregor, Your descriptions of Poyais have captured not merely my imagination but my commitment. I am pleased to inform you that I am outfitting an expedition; two ships, one hundred and forty settlers, adequate provisions for establishment of agricultural operations. We depart in eight weeks for the Mosquito Coast, there to claim lands and commence development of your remarkable territory.

I have taken the liberty of securing investors to fund this venture (your associate Lord Pemberton proved most helpful in recommendations). As Cazique and rightful sovereign, your guidance and blessing would honor our enterprise. Perhaps you might join us for the voyage home?  I remain your humble servant, Admiral Sir Charles Richardson

Felix read it twice. Three times. The words didn't change.  Two ships. A hundred and forty settlers. Eight weeks.  People were going to sail to Poyais. His Poyais. The one that existed on foolscap in a hotel escritoire and nowhere else on Earth.
He sat down on the bed, envelope crumpling in his suddenly nerveless fingers. The Art of the Con pressed against his ribs through the coat pocket, its wisdom suddenly feeling less like guidance and more like evidence for a prosecution that hadn't happened yet.

The Art of the Con: Chapter Fifteen: Know Your Exit.
Felix looked around the suite; the luxury he'd earned with nerve and a $20 chain, the invitations demanding his presence at dinners and salons and probably scientific lectures, the newspaper proclaiming him an expert on lands he'd never seen, the letter describing an expedition that would discover nothing but swamp and jungle and the complete absence of sugar plantations, banana groves, or gold mines. Eight weeks.  He pulled out the air freshener, that stupid little cardboard tree. Tomorrow's dinner invitation, the Duke of Manchester, no less would include natural philosophers and potential investors. They'd want details. Proof. Tangible evidence.  Felix held the air freshener to his nose, breathing chemical banana scent, and made a decision.

Go all in.

He had eight weeks to figure out his exit.  Felix opened the escritoire drawer, pulled out his maps and currency designs, and got back to work. Outside, London hummed with commerce and ambition. Inside, a failed college student with credit card debt and grand theft McNugget on his conscience created a nation with nothing but ink, desperation, and the uncomfortable realization that he was very, very good at this.  The banana air freshener sat on the desk beside him, waiting for tomorrow's performance.

The fog hadn't so much rolled in as congealed; thick, gray, turning Hyde Park's morning into something from a Gothic novel. Felix stood twenty paces back from the principals, his breath forming small clouds that merged with the larger atmospheric conspiracy to obscure what was about to happen. He'd seen duels in movies. This felt simultaneously more mundane and more terrible.

Mr. Ashworth and Sir Edmund Carstairs faced each other across carefully measured ground, their seconds; men whose primary qualification seemed to be ownership of good coats and steady nerves,conferred in voices too low to carry. Both duelists wore dark jackets, white shirts that would show blood beautifully, and expressions of grim determination that suggested this was somehow a reasonable way to resolve a property dispute.

A property dispute over land that didn't exist.  Felix's stomach, so recently satisfied by the Duke of Manchester's excellent dinner, now attempted complex acrobatics. The banana air freshener gambit had worked brilliantly; he'd presented it as "essence of the Poyaisian banana, distilled for transport," and three separate natural philosophers had nearly wept at the aroma, declaring it proof positive of the territory's agricultural wealth. Orders for land certificates had tripled.

Which led directly to this; two men, pistols, dawn, and Felix's careful map-making creating a fatal ambiguity about Plot 47's exact boundaries.
"Gentlemen," the senior second announced, voice carrying across the grass with the authority of ritual, "you have been afforded opportunity to resolve this matter with honor intact. Do either of you wish to offer satisfaction without recourse to arms?"  "I do not," Sir Edmund said, voice flat.  "Nor I," Ashworth replied. "My claim to the coastal acreage is documented and witnessed. I'll not surrender it to a man who seeks to profit from confusion."

I created the confusion, Felix thought, watching the seconds load pistols with practiced efficiency. I drew the maps drunk on hotel wine. I made up the survey markers. This is my fault.  "The terms," the second continued, "are as agreed. Ten paces, turn on command, single shot. Should both parties survive the exchange with honor satisfied, the matter is concluded regardless of outcome."

Felix wanted to speak. Wanted to step forward and say stop, it's fake, all of it, I made it up, there is no Plot 47. But the words stuck in his throat because speaking meant exposure, and exposure meant; what? Debtor's prison? Transportation? Hanging? British justice in 1820 probably had opinions about defrauding the aristocracy.
The principals took their positions, backs to each other. Morning light filtered weakly through fog, turning everything monochrome. Someone's horse whinnied from the tree line; probably belonging to a surgeon waiting discreetly out of sight, because of course there was a surgeon, because this was real.

"Gentlemen, begin your count."

They paced. Felix counted silently along; one, two, three... Ashworth's shoulders were rigid. Sir Edmund walked with the measured calm of a man who'd done this before. Seven, eight, nine… "Ten!"  They turned.
Two cracks split the morning,near-simultaneous, echoing across the park, sending birds exploding from nearby trees in panicked flight. Smoke curled from both pistols, acrid and immediate. For a heartbeat, nobody moved. Felix's chest constricted, waiting.  Then Ashworth's left arm jerked backward; not dramatic, not cinematic, just a sudden wrongness of movement. His pistol dropped. He looked down at his arm with an expression of profound confusion, like he'd discovered it wasn't his anymore. Blood spread across his white sleeve, dark and immediate.

"I believe Mr. Ashworth requires attention," his second said, voice admirably steady, and suddenly people were moving; the surgeon emerging from the trees at a run, Sir Edmund lowering his weapon with visible relief, seconds clustering around the wounded man.  Felix stood frozen, watching red soak white linen. Watching Ashworth's face cycle through shock, pain, then impossibly,something like satisfaction.

"Honorably done," Ashworth managed, voice tight. "Your claim... acknowledged."
The surgeon tore open the sleeve, revealing a mess Felix's modern sensibilities immediately categorized as bad,shattered bone, torn flesh, blood that wouldn't stop. The man worked with efficient brutality, calling for his bag, already discussing tourniquets and whether the arm could be saved.

Felix heard the answer in the surgeon's tone before words confirmed it; the arm was gone. Not today, but soon, sepsis would demand amputation, and Ashworth would carry this morning's honor for the rest of his life in the space where his arm used to be.

Over a property line Felix had drawn while half-drunk and wholly fraudulent.
"Mr. MacGregor." Sir Edmund approached, pistol handed off to his second, face flushed with adrenaline and the strange euphoria of surviving. "As witness to this affair, I trust you'll acknowledge the boundary dispute is now settled? Plot 47's coastal frontage belongs to my claim, as Mr. Ashworth has graciously conceded."
Felix stared at him. At the man who'd just shot someone. Who looked pleased about it. Who would go home and probably tell the story at dinner parties for years.

"Aye," Felix heard himself say, accent thick as the fog. "Acknowledged."
Sir Edmund clapped him on the shoulder; friendly, like they'd just concluded a successful business transaction and strode toward his carriage. The surgeon worked over Ashworth, who'd begun making small sounds of pain that cut through the morning like accusations. His second held his good hand, murmuring reassurances about honor and courage and how proud his family would be.

Felix turned away.  He walked through the fog, past the tree line, into the park proper where London was beginning its daily resurrection; vendors setting up, maids on errands, the city's great machine grinding forward with no knowledge that twenty yards away a man had been maimed over imaginary real estate.

The expedition sailed in seven weeks. Admiral Richardson's settlers, equipped with Felix's maps and land certificates and currency that wouldn't buy anything because nothing existed to purchase. They'd arrive at the Mosquito Coast expecting cities and plantations and a functioning government. They'd find jungle and swamp and the complete absence of everything Felix had promised.

Some of them would die. Not from bullets in formal duels with seconds and surgeons standing by, but from disease and starvation and the slow horror of realizing they'd been sold a beautiful lie. He needed to leave London. Needed to be gone before those ships returned empty and angry. Needed to disappear before Ashworth's arm healed (or didn't) and someone started asking harder questions.

France. He dreged up memories of his high school french. Felix could do that, escape before the body count.  He hailed a cab; easier now that he knew how, now that he looked like he belonged, and gave the Regency's address. He had perhaps a week before his absence would seem suspicious. A week to book passage across the Channel, to become someone other than the Cazique.

The cab rattled through awakening streets. Felix watched London scroll past; a city he'd inhabited for barely a month, a city he'd nearly destroyed with nothing but maps and lies and a $20 chain.  The Art of the Con sat heavy in his lap. He'd followed every principle, executed every technique, sold the dream so completely that men were willing to bleed for it.  And that, Felix realized as the Regency came into view, was exactly the problem.  Some cons were too successful.
Some cons needed to fail.

Paris smelled different than London; less coal smoke, more bread and wine and something floral Felix couldn't identify. He'd crossed the Channel with forged papers (harder to forge than Poyais currency, as it turned out, but desperation bred competence), a backpack full of stolen identity, and enough guilt to sink the packet boat.

The city welcomed him with the indifference of a place too sophisticated to care about one more exile with money and secrets.  Six months after the duel, Felix stood in the doorway of his own establishment, watching dancers rehearse on a stage he'd designed with principles borrowed from every nightclub he'd ever been thrown out of in 2020. Le Poyais occupied a converted warehouse in Pigalle; before Pigalle became Pigalle, before the Moulin Rouge would make this neighborhood synonymous with exactly what Felix was pioneering seventy years early.  "Monsieur Felix!" Marie, his stage manager (and possibly the only person in Paris who knew his real first name), hurried over with a stack of the new promotional postcards. "They arrived from the printer. Magnifique, non?"  Felix took one. The image showed a dancer in strategic tropical foliage, the text promising "Les Mystères Exotiques de Poyais; Spectacle Unique à Paris." In the corner, small print, "Featuring authentic artifacts from the New World."

Those artifacts decorated the club's interior: his $20 chain hung in a glass case labeled "Or des Mines de Poyais," the banana air freshener (now completely scent-depleted) mounted beside a painted backdrop of palm trees, even one of his hand-drawn maps framed on the wall as "art." Everything that had been a lie in London became honest theater in Paris.

The French didn't care if Poyais was real. They cared that it was divertissant.
"They're perfect," Felix told Marie, and meant it. The postcards would sell. The memberships were filling up; merchants, minor nobility, students from the Latin Quarter with more enthusiasm than money. He'd priced entry to capture every tier cheap enough for the curious, expensive enough to feel exclusive.
The Art of the Con, Chapter Nineteen; Give them what they came for.

Felix had finally figured out what that meant; not a lie they'd defend with their lives, but a fantasy they enjoyed for an evening and went home happy.  "Monsieur!" The doorman appeared, breathless, waving a newspaper. "You should see this. From London."

Felix's stomach executed its now-familiar dropping maneuver. Six months, and he still expected the knock on the door, the extradition, the reckoning.
But the headline wasn't about him; POYAIS SCHEME COLLAPSES, MACGREGOR FACES SCANDAL
Felix grabbed the paper, scanning rapidly. The expedition had returned; what was left of it. Three-quarters dead from disease and starvation, survivors describing a "wasteland of deception." No cities, no plantations, no infrastructure. The real Gregor MacGregor, it seemed, had resurfaced in London around the time Felix departed, had claimed credit for the Poyais venture (naturally, it was his con, after all), and now faced parliamentary inquiry, lawsuits, and social exile.
The article included details Felix recognized,his maps, his currency designs, even a mention of "gold artifacts of questionable authenticity." MacGregor, the paper reported, maintained the territories were real but "temporarily inaccessible due to native unrest."

Felix read it twice, then a third time, waiting for his name to appear.  It didn't.
Gregor MacGregor,the real Gregor MacGregor had taken the fall for Felix's improved version of his own con. The historical record would blame a Scottish soldier and adventurer, not a time-displaced college dropout with credit card debt and a talent for accidental fraud.

"Bad news, Monsieur?" Marie asked, concern creasing her face.  "No," Felix said slowly, folding the newspaper. "Actually... I think I just got away with it."
He thought of Ashworth's arm. Of the settlers who'd died believing in a paradise that never existed. Of Lord Pemberton and Sir Edmund and the Duke of Manchester and all the others who'd thrown money at a dream because a desperate kid from 2020 had stumbled through time into the right moment with the right lies.

The guilt would probably never leave. But neither would the knowledge that he'd learned something; that there was a line between selling lies and selling entertainment, between fraud and honest spectacle.  Le Poyais was that line, walked carefully.  "The dancers need notes," Marie prompted. "Opening night is three days."

Felix tucked the newspaper under his arm and followed her into the club. The stage gleamed under gaslight. The tropical backdrop, painted by an actual artist, not sketched drunk in a hotel; promised exactly what it delivered a fantasy, escapism, a brief vacation from Paris reality.  No one would die for this Poyais.  No one would lose an arm.

People would pay admission, watch beautiful humans dance in strategically minimal clothing, buy overpriced champagne and those postcards, and leave happy. Honest transaction. Honest fantasy.  

The Art of the Con remained in his rooms at the apartment above the club, its lessons absorbed and transformed. Felix had started as its student, become its practitioner, and finally maybe; graduated into something that used its principles for purposes that didn't require fleeing countries.

Opening night arrived in a blur of last-minute crises and first-night jitters. Felix stood in the wings, watching the crowd fill his club, merchants and students and even a few minor aristocrats slumming it in Pigalle. The lights dimmed. Music started,a band he'd assembled playing arrangements that wouldn't sound dated for decades because Felix remembered what worked.

The dancers took the stage.  Paris applauded.  Felix exhaled.  Three months later, Le Poyais was the talk of the city. Six months after that, he opened a second location. A year in, he'd legitimized his operation enough that banks loaned him money without asking too many questions about his accent or his past.

But mostly, Felix focused forward. On his clubs, his dancers, his business that sold fantasy honestly and delivered what it promised. On being someone other than the Cazique, other than Felix Bumgartner with his credit card debt and stolen McNuggets.

Just Felix. Proprietor of Le Poyais. Purveyor of exotic entertainment and French postcards.  Former time traveler. Former con artist.  Current entrepreneur in the world's oldest profession, just with better lighting and a business plan.
He never went back to London. Never tried to return to 2020, even if a path existed.

Sometimes, late at night after the club closed, Felix would stand on his balcony overlooking Pigalle and think about that moment in the research lab; the stumble, the field, the impossible journey that landed him here.  He'd survived by being smarter than his circumstances. By taking a failed con artist's handbook and applying it in an era that hadn't built immunity yet. By running the same grift as history's Gregor MacGregor and letting that man take the blame.
Not heroic, exactly.  But thoroughly, undeniably human. And on his best nights, when the club was full and the champagne flowed and nobody was getting shot over property lines he'd invented, Felix thought maybe; just maybe,he'd figured out how to fuck yeah his way through the nineteenth century after all.  Even if it started with stolen chicken nuggets and ended with strategic nudity.
Some success stories were just like that.
