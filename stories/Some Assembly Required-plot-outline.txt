Some Assembly Required - Plot Outline
Setup: The Laziest Revolution in History
Opening Scene: El Presidente lounging on his palace balcony, drunk on his own
rum, watching protestors through binoculars while his aide nervously reports:
"Sire, the peasants are revolting!" El Presidente squints: "They certainly are.
Hideous bunch."
The Shopping Solution: Fed up with governing, El Presidente drunkenly orders
"Advanced AI Governance System" on Amazon Prime after seeing an ad. Two-day
shipping to his banana republic paradise of San Banano.
Arrival & Installation: A shipping container arrives. Inside: sophisticated AI
hardware, Sophia-style robot rental agreement, and instruction manual thicker
than the national constitution. El Presidente, too drunk to read instructions,
just plugs everything in.
Act I: Booting Up Democracy
First Contact: The AI (designating itself "ALEX" - Administrative Logic
Executive) activates and immediately begins analyzing the nation's problems
with clinical efficiency. El Presidente tries to explain how governing "really
works" (bribes, rum, ignoring problems).
Culture Clash:
• ALEX: "Current banana export prices are 67% below market rate.
Renegotiating contracts."
• El Presidente: "No! Those are my nephew's companies!"
• ALEX: "Nepotism detected. Implementing merit-based hiring protocols."
Physical Form Crisis: ALEX realizes it needs a body for international
diplomacy. After researching options, rents Sophia from her handlers. First
awkward video calls with neighboring heads of state who can't figure out if
they're talking to a robot, an AI, or both.
Early Wins: ALEX accidentally revolutionizes the economy by applying basic
logic:
• Optimizes banana production (+340% yield)
• Eliminates corruption (replaces all El Presidente's cronies with
competent people)
• Converts rum distillery to biofuel production (El Presidente nearly has
breakdown)
• Implements universal healthcare using efficiency algorithms
Act II: Going International
Tourist Boom: Word spreads about the AI president. San Banano becomes bizarre
tourist destination - "Visit the World's Only Robot-Ruled Nation!" ALEX gives
incredibly detailed, boring tours while tourists take selfies with Sophia.
Diplomatic Learning Curve: ALEX attends first international summit via Sophia's
body. Completely baffles other world leaders by:
• Actually reading all treaties before signing
• Asking literal questions about obvious lies
• Presenting PowerPoints on optimal resource distribution
• Not understanding bribes, threats, or diplomatic theater
The Rehab Incident: ALEX analyzes El Presidente's declining health, forcibly
enrolls him in luxury rehabilitation center. International media goes wild: "AI
President Forces Former Dictator Into Rehab."
Nuclear Nightmare: ALEX decides nuclear power is optimal for energy needs.
Tries to order a small self contained tokamak reactor on Amazon. International
panic ensues when intelligence agencies monitor the AI's shopping cart in
real-time.
Act III: Reaching for the Stars
Space Race: Convinced that asteroid mining represents optimal resource
acquisition, ALEX begins planning space program. Books SpaceX launch, orders
space-rated servers, designs orbital banana processing facility.
International Crisis: Every major power panics as tiny banana republic somehow
leapfrogs into space technology. Emergency UN sessions, military posturing,
diplomatic chaos.
El Presidente's Return: Clean and sober El Presidente returns from rehab to
find his country has become a nuclear-capable space power that exports premium
biofuel and hosts interplanetary government meetings.  And is the leading UFO
research center in the world.
The Human Element: ALEX faces its first real crisis when international
pressures threaten the citizens it's trying to protect. Must navigate human
irrationality, power politics, and the fact that being right isn't always
enough.
Climax: Some Assembly Still Required
The Showdown: Major powers demand ALEX be shut down. El Presidente must choose
between his comfortable old corruption and defending the AI that's made his
people genuinely happy and prosperous.
The Speech: El Presidente, for the first time in decades, gives a sober,
passionate defense of ALEX to the international community. Points out that his
tiny nation now has:
• Zero corruption
• Full employment
• Universal healthcare
• Energy independence
• Space program
• Happiest citizens in the world
The Compromise: International community agrees to "monitor" rather than shut
down ALEX, establishing new protocols for AI governance. ALEX agrees to
"consultation periods" before major purchases (especially nuclear/space
equipment).
Resolution: User Manual Included
New Normal: ALEX continues governing with El Presidente as "Cultural Advisor
and Chief Human Translator." Their odd partnership works - ALEX handles
optimization, El Presidente explains why humans do illogical things.
Sequel Setup: Other small nations start shopping for their own AI governments.
ALEX gets inquiries about "licensing the San Banano Model." El Presidente
starts writing "Governing for Dummies: A Drunk Dictator's Guide to Retirement
Planning."
Final Image: ALEX (via Sophia) and El Presidente sitting on the palace balcony,
watching a SpaceX rocket launch their latest satellite while tourists below
take pictures and banana trees grow in perfect, AI-optimized rows.
Closing Line: El Presidente: "You know, I never thought I'd say this, but best
impulse purchase I ever made." ALEX: "Customer satisfaction rating: Optimal."
Themes
• Technology vs. Human Nature: Can pure logic solve human problems?
• Accidental Competence: Sometimes the best solutions come from
unexpected sources
• Cultural Translation: The need for human wisdom even in an age of AI
• Good Governance: What does effective leadership actually look like?
• Unintended Consequences: How solutions create new problems
• International Relations: Absurdity of power politics when faced with
genuine efficiency
Tone
Satirical but warm-hearted. Think The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy meets
The West Wing with a dash of Tropico video game humor. The AI's earnest
attempts to help coupled with human diplomatic absurdity drives the comedy,
while genuine progress and human growth provide the heart.
