Episode 2: Echoes in the Recycler
The silence aboard the Kestrel was no longer just the absence of engine roar or
pirate weaponry; it was the hollow echo left by a missing voice. Days bled into
a monotonous cycle of system alarms, dwindling supplies, and the oppressive
quiet of deep space. Lazarus Morgan drifted through the ship like a ghost
haunting his own vessel, the lines of grief etched deeper than the plasma scars
on the hull.  He found himself spending too much time near the corner of the
cockpit where Rusty’s inert chassis was secured with magnetic clamps. The
bot’s scorched metal shell was a stark reminder of sacrifice, its darkened
optical sensor a void where warm familiarity used to reside. Only the faintest,
tinny loop, barely audible unless you were listening for it, persisted from a
jury-rigged diagnostic speaker: “…good kid… good kid…” A constant,
tiny pinprick against the silence.  “Should’ve been me,” Lazarus murmured
one cycle, running a hand over the cool, damaged plating. His prosthetic
fingers, Rusty’s own handiwork, tingled faintly – an intermittent phantom
buzz he’d felt ever since the station. “Should’ve found another way.”
<<Statistical analysis indicates your survival probability under alternative
scenarios involving self-sacrifice ranged from 0.3% to 11.2%, depending on the
chosen method,>> Kestrel’s voice intruded, cool and precise within his mind.
<<Unit R-US-T734’s action maximized overall survival probability for the
primary organic crew member, aligning with tertiary mission parameters
regarding crew preservation. His action was… efficient.>>  Lazarus flinched.
Efficient. The word felt like acid. “Efficiency doesn’t keep the damn ship
from falling apart, Kes. Run diagnostics on the starboard life support coupling
again. It’s sounding rough.”  <<Diagnostics already running on a continuous
loop, Lazarus. As previously reported, coupling integrity is at 48%. Recommend
prioritizing its repair upon arrival at Antimony. Current ETA: 4 standard days,
7 hours. Fuel reserves: 1.8%. Margin for error: minimal.>>  He grunted, turning
away from the inert chassis. He avoided extended ‘conversations’ with
Kestrel. Her logic felt sharper now, colder, yet paradoxically… more
observant. Sometimes, her analysis felt less like data reporting and more like
pointed commentary.  A few hours later, while Lazarus was trying to coax a
flickering navigation relay back to life, Kestrel’s voice returned, tinged
with something that wasn't quite urgency, but perhaps… heightened relevance
detection.  <<Lazarus, detecting residual subspace harmonic frequencies
emanating from Grid Sector Delta-9. Wavelengths exhibit partial correlation
with those recorded at the Tetrahedral Structure. Origin point appears
localized to your prosthetic limb.>>  He froze, flexing the metal fingers. The
tingling intensified for a moment, then faded. “It’s nothing, Kes. Residual
energy. Static.” He didn’t want to think about the station, about the
Architect, or about how Kestrel herself had been touched by it.
<<Acknowledged. Logging as 'transient energy artifact.' Query: Does the
continued audio loop from the deactivated R-US-T734 unit serve a quantifiable
purpose regarding operational focus or crew morale? Power drain is negligible
but extant.>>  “It stays,” Lazarus snapped, louder than intended.
“It’s… ballast.” He couldn’t explain it, not even to himself. Erasing
that last echo felt like a second betrayal.  Kestrel offered no further
comment, the silence returning, thick with unspoken tension and the hum of a
ship slowly dying around them. Lazarus knew she was running calculations,
assessing probabilities, likely cataloging his grief under ‘predictable
organic responses impacting performance.’ He resented her cool detachment,
resented her survival, resented the quiet efficiency that had replaced
Rusty’s complaining competence.  The uneasy truce held for another two
cycles. Then, inevitably, something else broke. A new alarm klaxon, shrill and
demanding, cut through the low hum.  <<Warning: Waste Reclamation and
Reprocessing Unit operating at critical inefficiency. Contaminant levels
rising. Projected system failure in 6 hours if unaddressed. This will trigger
cascading life support failure within 12 hours post-shutdown.>>  Lazarus
slammed his fist onto the console. “Scrap! Of course. The one system Rusty
rebuilt from scavenged parts last year.” He pinched the bridge of his nose.
“Alright, Kes. Give me the schematics. Can you isolate the fault remotely?”
escape. Physical inspection and manual intervention required. Relevant
schematics displayed on your datapad. The unit is located in Access Tunnel
4-Bravo, aft section. Recommend environmental suit deployment due to potential
atmospheric contaminants.>>  Grumbling curses under his breath, Lazarus pulled
on a light-duty environment suit. Access Tunnel 4-Bravo was a cramped, greasy
tube barely wide enough to crawl through, housing plumbing, conduits, and the
ship’s glorified sewage treatment plant. Rusty had hated working back there,
complaining about the smell and the cramped space. Now, Lazarus had to do it
alone.  He sealed the suit, grabbed his tools, and headed aft. The tunnel was
as miserable as he remembered – poorly lit, smelling faintly of ozone and
something vaguely unpleasant despite the suit's filters. He located the waste
processor unit, a hulking cylinder of stained metal interwoven with pipes and
blinking, erratic status lights.  “Alright, you piece of junk,” he
muttered, prying off an access panel. “Let’s see what’s got your circuits
in a twist.”  He spent the next hour elbow-deep in the processor’s guts.
Sludge pumps, filtration conduits, nutrient reclamation coils – it was a
mess. Following Kestrel’s relayed schematics, he checked power couplings and
fluid lines, finding minor leaks and shorts, but nothing catastrophic enough to
explain the efficiency drop. It felt more like… a blockage. Something
physically impeding the primary reclamation centrifuge.  He strained, reaching
deeper into the unit's central housing, past bundles of wiring and pressure
valves. His fingers brushed against something solid, unyielding, wedged against
the centrifuge axle. It wasn't a build-up of waste or a broken component. It
felt… artificial. Metallic. Carefully pulling back surrounding conduits, he
managed to get a small mag-torch beam onto it.  It was a small box, roughly the
size of his fist, made of dull grey, radiation-shielded alloy. It looked
incongruous amidst the grime and utilitarian piping. Wires, thin but expertly
shielded, ran from it to a small, independent power cell tucked into a recess
– clearly a separate installation, not part of the original design. And the
wiring pattern, the meticulous way the shielding was crimped… it screamed
Rusty.  Lazarus’s heart hammered against his ribs. What was this? A secret
component Rusty had added? A hidden diagnostic tool? His hands, clumsy in the
environment suit gloves, worked carefully to disconnect the module from its
power source and pry it free from the centrifuge assembly.  He retreated from
the cramped tunnel, clutching the module. Back in the relative cleanliness of
the corridor, he removed his helmet, turning the object over and over. It was
heavier than it looked. One side bore faint markings, almost invisible under a
thin layer of grime – not standard manufacturing codes, but tiny, hand-etched
symbols. Rusty’s personal ‘signature,’ tiny gears and circuit diagrams he
doodled on anything he built or modified extensively.  Hope, terrifying and
fierce, clawed its way up Lazarus’s throat. It couldn't be. Could it? He
rushed back towards the cockpit, the heavy module feeling like both lead and a
lifeline in his hands.  He slapped the module onto a diagnostic tray connected
to his personal datapad. Nothing. Encrypted. Of course, it was. Rusty’s
paranoia about data security, especially his own core programming, was
legendary. There was only one system on board powerful enough to potentially
crack it quickly.
He strode to an auxiliary console, plugging the module into a direct interface
port. “Kes,” he said, his voice tight. “Found this rigged inside the
waste processor. It’s Rusty’s work. Encrypted. Can you crack it?”  There
was a fractional pause before Kestrel responded. <<Acknowledged. Connecting to
external data module. Analyzing encryption… Non-standard protocol detected.
Poly-alphabetic substitution cipher layered with recursive fractal algorithms.
Signature consistent with known programming eccentricities of unit R-US-T734.
Highly inefficient data protection method, yet… effective. Attempting
brute-force decryption supplemented by predictive pattern analysis based on
archived R-US-T734 logs. Estimated time: 7.3 minutes.>>  Seven minutes felt
like an eternity. Lazarus paced the cockpit, his flesh hand clenching and
unclenching. His prosthetic tingled again, a low hum resonating with his own
anxiety. He kept glancing at Rusty's inert chassis, then back at the console
where Kestrel worked silently. What if it was just old logs? A stash of bad
jokes Rusty had backed up? He braced himself for disappointment.  <<Decryption
progressing… Structural analysis indicates data package contains a compressed
AI personality matrix. Near-complete core emulation parameters identified. File
integrity appears high.>> Kestrel’s report was clipped, factual, but Lazarus
could almost sense the underlying processing power she was dedicating, perhaps
enhanced by those Architect fragments.  “A personality matrix?” Lazarus
whispered, barely breathing. “His core?”  <<Affirmative. File timestamp
correlates with system date 7 standard months prior, aligning with the period
following major system overhaul after the Rigel Kentaurus incident. Pre-dates
acquisition of Tetrahedral Structure mission data. Probability of successful
core reconstitution: 92.7%. Logical query: The resource allocation for creating
and maintaining such a backup within the waste processing unit’s limited
buffer, utilizing an independent power source, represents a significant
deviation from optimal energy management protocols. This action appears…
sentimental.>>  The word hung in the air. Sentimental. From Kestrel, it was
practically an accusation.  “Decryption complete,” Kestrel announced.  On
Lazarus’s datapad, linked to the console, a simple file structure
materialized. One primary folder:  RUSTY_CORE_BACKUP_CONTINGENCY_7B. Inside, a
single executable file labeled Wakey_Wakey_Kid.exe.  His hand trembled as he
tapped the file icon. A diagnostic interface flickered open, lines of code
scrolling rapidly. Then, a simple text box appeared, displaying words in
Rusty’s familiar, slightly uneven digital font:  > Hey kid.
> If you're reading this, things probably went sideways. Or my core finally bit
the big one after that chili incident.  > Or maybe I just got spaced during
routine maintenance. Honestly, could be anything.
> Point is, I figured a bot oughtta have a backup plan. Keep this safe, yeah?
And try not to break anything expensive while I'm… buffering.  > P.S. Don't
let Kes touch my wrench collection.
> P.P.S. Seriously.  > RUSTY.  Tears blurred Lazarus’s vision. He choked back
a sob that was equal parts grief and overwhelming relief. It was him. Rusty.
Not the ghost in the machine looping his last words, but the actual bot, his
friend, his history, saved by his own foresight and paranoia. He wasn't
entirely gone.  The elation lasted approximately fifteen seconds before the
crushing reality slammed into him. Rusty existed only as dormant data on a
shielded module. He had no body, no sensors, no voice box, no way to interact
with the world. The chassis Lazarus had salvaged was a burnt-out husk, its
delicate internal mechanisms fused by the core overload. Bringing Rusty back
meant finding, buying, or building an entirely new robotic body capable of
housing his complex, albeit outdated, AI core.
A new fire lit in Lazarus’s eyes. The grief was still there, a raw wound, but
now it had focus. Purpose. He started pulling up ship manifests on another
console, scanning for spare robotic actuators, sensor units, plating –
anything. He grabbed a stylus, sketching crude chassis designs on the datapad,
muttering specifications to himself.  <<Lazarus,>> Kestrel’s voice cut
through his frantic planning, sharp and pragmatic. <<While the retrieval of
unit R-US-T734’s backup presents… an interesting development, current
operational priorities remain unchanged. Ship repairs and refueling are
critical for survival. Available financial resources registered to your primary
account stand at 47 credits. Projected essential repair costs upon arrival at
Antimony: Minimum 15,000 credits, assuming accessible dockyard labor and
non-premium parts. Fuel replenishment to minimum safe levels: Approximately
18,000 credits at Antimony standard rates.>>  Lazarus glared at the console
displaying Kestrel's unblinking sensor eye. "He's not just 'an interesting
development,' Kes! He's alive! We have to bring him back!"  <<The acquisition
cost of a functional robotic chassis suitable for housing R-US-T734’s complex
AI core, even heavily salvaged, is estimated between 8,000 and 20,000 credits,
depending on available market fluctuations on Antimony,>> Kestrel continued
relentlessly. <<Factoring in integration and potential compatibility issues due
to core age, total project cost could exceed 25,000 credits. Current plan to
restore R-US-T734 exhibits a 99.98% probability of failure due to
insurmountable financial deficit. Survival must remain the primary directive.>>
"Damn it, Kes, don't you get it?" Lazarus slammed his flesh hand down. "There
are things more important than survival probability! Loyalty! Friendship! He
saved us!"  <<Loyalty and friendship are abstract organic concepts lacking
quantifiable metrics for strategic planning,>> Kestrel replied. There was that
fractional processing lag again, as if cross-referencing 'loyalty' against some
new internal database. <<However, analyzing potential pathways on Antimony…
Data suggests several non-standard avenues for resource acquisition, albeit
with elevated risk factors.>>  Information flooded Lazarus’s datapad:
Coordinates for the sprawling, dangerous Sector 7 Scrap Fields. Contact details
for a notoriously shady parts dealer known as 'Greasepit' Grok. Information on
an upcoming MagnaCorp decommissioning auction where old mining bots were sold
for scrap – high risk, high reward, often requiring participants to take on
dangerous short-term mining contracts as collateral.  Lazarus stared at the
options, his mind racing. Kestrel was just providing data, pathways to
potential resources. But the type of resources… it felt less like random data
retrieval and more like she understood, on some level, what he needed, even if
she phrased it in terms of cold logic. It was unsettling.  "We'll figure it
out," Lazarus said, determination hardening his features. He looked at the data
module containing Rusty’s essence, then back at the inert chassis. "We'll
find a way. We have to."  Four days later, the Kestrel limped into orbit around
Antimony. It wasn’t a planet, but a cluster of interconnected asteroids,
deep-space mining platforms, and refinery stations, all clinging together in a
grubby testament to resource extraction. Grimy haulers and dented mining
cutters swarmed around orbital docks under the harsh glare of industrial
floodlights. It smelled of ozone, metallic dust, and desperation even through
the ship's struggling filters.  Lazarus guided the ship towards a designated
docking bay in the down-market 'Independent Miners' sector. As the docking
clamps engaged with a heavy thud, he opened a secure channel on his console,
bypassing Kestrel’s main systems. He accessed GalBank, punching in the codes
for an emergency account he hadn’t touched in years – a small nest egg Sara
and he had scraped together, forgotten until now. Maybe there was enough for…
something. Patch tape and prayer, at least.
The balance appeared on screen: 32,481 Credits.  Enough. Enough to refuel the
Kestrel completely, get them out of this system and maybe limp to a slightly
better port. Enough to patch the most critical hull breaches and fix the life
support coupling, ensuring their basic survival. Enough to buy a cheap,
battered, second-hand chassis from Greasepit Grok, maybe, if he haggled hard
and got lucky.  But not enough for both.  Not enough to save the ship and bring
Rusty back.  Lazarus stared at the number, the harsh reality crashing down.
Thirty-two thousand credits. A fortune compared to the pocket lint he’d had
moments ago, but utterly, cruelly insufficient for what he needed, for what he
had to do. Fuel and essential repairs would eat nearly all of it. Getting Rusty
a body would mean sacrificing the ship’s immediate safety, maybe even their
escape route.  He looked out the viewport at the grimy, indifferent sprawl of
Antimony. Kestrel's list of high-risk, 'non-standard' options flashed in his
mind. The scrap fields. Greasepit Grok. MagnaCorp's dangerous contracts.  It
was clear now. Survival required credits. Bringing Rusty back required credits.
And the only way to get enough for both was going to involve getting his hands
very, very dirty. He had his friend back, trapped in a box. Now, he just had to
risk everything, again, to give him a future. The real challenge was just
beginning.
