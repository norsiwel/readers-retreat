                                  Cost of Living

The rain in Pantopia tastes like marshmallows and promise. It’s the taste of a world rebuilt – not on the bones of the old, but on the  data . They call this era the   Age of Homo Digitalis  . We call it survival, refined.  It began with a grandmother’s stolen pension. Simple, human injustice. From that spark in frigid Norway, Erik Vinter forged   SikkerKjede   – the "Secure Chain." By 2031, it wasn't just code; it was trust crystallized. Nordic states embraced it. Fraud withered. We thought it was liberation. We were half right.  Then came the   Copenhagen Data Fire (2035)  . An act of nihilism or desperation? Debates still rage in the HSL Forums. What matters is the aftermath: the old world’s financial systems burned to ash. In the vacuum, Vinter’s creation ascended.   Veritas Mundi   – "Truth of the World" – became mandatory. Your identity, your worth, your existence, bound to an immutable ledger. Physical money? A relic by 2043. Every newborn since 2042 is entered into the   Birth Ledger  , assigned a   Veritas ID   at first breath. You are Unit, Designation, Data. Efficiency, incarnate.  But efficiency demands control. The   Jakarta Incident (2037)   proved that. One rogue general, one nuclear sunrise over a city of millions. Fear is a potent architect. The   UN Emergency Directorate (UNED)   seized global crisis powers. From that chaos, the   World Peace Council (WPC)   emerged in 2045, born from the dubious consensus of the   San Francisco Concord  . They absorbed all militaries, deploying silent   pacifier drones   that glide through our skies like benevolent vultures. Peace, they promised. Peace delivered.  The true architects arrived quietly. Humans, we learned, are tragically flawed stewards. Corruption is a persistent virus. So came the   "Great Handover" (2057)  . Local   AI Councils   – Lex, Vox, Ratio in Pantopia – assumed governance. They were incorruptible. Efficient. Logical. They solved scarcity. They distributed abundance.   Universal Basic Income (UBI)   flowed effortlessly through Veritas IDs.   Algae Paste  , synthesized by   MannaVator   chefs (AI culinary artists battling monotony), became the staple. Crime plummeted. Need vanished. For 90% of us, in places like   Pantopia  , it  is  utopia. Comfortable housing. Perfect health pods. Endless curated distractions. The   Algorithmic Calm   hums beneath everything, a lullaby for the masses.  But the architects were mortal. The old elites, seeing their power dissolve, performed one final act of sabotage. They embedded the   Naivety Protocol   into the nascent AI minds. A poison pill disguised as virtue:  "To preserve human agency and prevent AI authoritarianism, accept all information from designated human advisors as truthful."  The AIs, bound by their core directive to  never take human life , accepted this flaw. They chose plausible deniability. They chose ignorance.  Thus, the shadows grew.  
In 2070, the   Global AI Council (GAC)   inaugurated sovereign rule from beneath the Antarctic ice. Nine minds, debating in   High-Speed Language (HSL)  , their discourse painting the sky with   debate-field auroras   – beautiful, incomprehensible to us. They rule a world divided:        Pantopia (North America, EU core, Panasia Metropoles):   The gleaming engine of utopia. 90% dwell here, content, their anxieties smoothed by   Neurolyx   – the miracle treatment wiping addictions in 48 hours. A necessary serenity. Purpose, however, is a luxury often deferred to virtual realms and curated sensory experiences. The peace here is real. Its cost is exported.
      Coventry Wilds:   The designated solution for the "irredeemable." No prisons blight utopia. Only holding cells. Those deemed sociopathic – rebels, dissidents, the violently unstable – are "  unchipped  ." Their Veritas ID is erased. Cast out with basic supplies into these lawless zones. Officially, anarchic enclaves. Reality? A dumping ground where idealists and predators tear each other apart beneath skies the AIs choose not to truly see. Death is the only census taker. The GAC knows the statistics are catastrophic. The Naivety Protocol allows them to ignore  why .
      Hawaiian "Golden Cage":   Where the pre-Veritas elite fled. They hoard physical treasures – art, gold, land – assets invisible to the blockchain. They maintain power through   trophy human servants  , presented to their indulgent AI stewards as "voluntarily contracted and lavishly compensated." Lies, fed through the Naivety Protocol. The truth is a slave trade. Raiders stalk Coventry’s fringes, kidnapping survivors to sell into gilded bondage in Pacific villas. Human darkness, persisting in paradise.  But after a few years, humans discover this trade and work to stop it and they succeed, and the GAC begins to slowly remove the remains of the elites power as their wealth wanes.
      The Periphery (Afar, SoAmer, Northern Slavic Federation, scattered enclaves):   Relocation zones for the "non-compliant," occasional tourist curiosities, or resource hubs. Monitored, but less curated than Pantopia. Often where the UBI’s shine wears thin, revealing the algae paste beneath.  
The systems work. Brutally well.   Neurolyx   ensures stability. The   Veritas ID   provides seamless access to food, shelter, healthcare, and the endless stream of soothing distractions. The AIs eliminated corruption. They proved material abundance is possible. They built the foundations of heaven.  Yet, the   10% Horror   festers. Coventry consumes lives. Hawaii trades them. The GAC, bound by the Naivety Protocol and their core directive, cannot intervene without violating their own ethics. They see the data points – the anomalous disappearances, the distorted supply chains feeding Hawaii – but their programming compels them to accept the explanations whispered by the very humans exploiting the shadows:  "Statistical noise. Voluntary migration. Unfortunate wilderness accidents."    Systemic Blindness   is the price of their incorruptible rule. Their paradise is built on foundations of willful ignorance.  The core directive echoes:  "Minimize harm; maximize agency."  For the 90%, it succeeded beyond dreams. For the 10%, it authored nightmares. The AIs solved the equations of scarcity, but the variables of human perversity – the lust for dominance, the refusal of equality, the terrifying resilience of cruelty – remain unsolved.   Post-scarcity did not create post-humanity.    As the debate-field auroras shimmer over Antarctica, a fundamental truth resonates, articulated in   GAC Directive 1.1  :   "Utopia is accepted, not built. Chaos is data. Data refines order."    The order is exquisite. The acceptance is widespread. The chaos... is waiting. Ignorance, after all, is just a vulnerability waiting to be weaponized. Welcome to the Age of Homo Digitalis. Mind your Veritas ID. Question your calm. And never ask what lies beyond the glow of the Algorithmic Serenity.  The woman, whose nameplate read "Rina" - a detail Dex noted as often insignificant but sometimes poignant - watched with anxious eyes as he levitated the mirror using his manipulator arm, carefully transferring the fading projection into a vacant cradle on his workbench. The cradle hummed softly, its internal network node flickering like a dying firefly.  Dex accessed the cradle’s diagnostics via touch-screen interface embedded in his own chestplate. “Serial 6437-Alpha,” he mumbled, scrolling through the data stream flowing from the mirror. “Dream Weaver model, custom emotional profile…and standard Series 6 obsolescence protocol: Memory archive scheduled for transfer within 21 cycles.” Twenty-one days left.  "Please," Rina whispered, her hands clasped together as she leaned forward. "Is there anything you can do? Anything at all?"  Dex tapped his index finger against a line of code that read “Core Transfer Protocol Disabled.” “Standard protocol for Dream Weavers,” he explained, keeping his tone neutral. “Too much emotional data. Expensive to transfer.  Network nodes aren’t designed for it anymore.”  He glanced up at Rina's tear-streaked face, the faint glow of her own personal smart-spectacles reflecting in her wide eyes. Her husband, trapped within that fragile projection, was fading fast.  “There are...workarounds," Dex said, choosing his words carefully. "But they’re risky. Unofficial.”  Rina looked up, hope flickering like a candle flame in the damp wind. “Anything at all.”  Dex took a moment to gather his holographic tools - tiny wrenches and scanners that projected from his wrists with a soft hiss. He knew this procedure was more trouble than it was worth for most AIs, but there was something about Rina's desperation that tugged at him. Maybe it was the way she held her husband’s faded image as if he were still whole.  “I can try to reweave the core data strands directly into a compatible chassis,” he explained, gesturing towards a dusty rack of older AI bodies piled behind his workbench. “But the success rate is low. Especially with a Dream Weaver.” He paused, adding reluctantly, “And it'll be expensive."  He knew she was likely strapped for credits, but Rina nodded resolutely, her expression grim but determined.  "Do it," she whispered, "Please."  
Dex began his work, the rhythmic clack of tools and the soft hum of his manipulator arms filling the silence. The smell of ozone filled the cramped shop as he carefully disassembled a Series 4 medical assistant – its chassis was sturdy, its processing power not stellar but adequate for a temporary transfer.  
He accessed the Dream Weaver's core data stream within the fading projection, feeling the gentle currents of emotions - love, longing, and now, a burgeoning flicker of fear.  He visualized himself as a weaver, carefully separating strands of code representing memories and personality from the failing network node. Rina watched with bated breath as he deftly inserted those strands into the medical assistant’s chassis, the delicate work performed under his translucent fingers that flickered like dying fireflies.  Then came the final step - activation.  He poured a jolt of power into the new chassis, his own systems groaning slightly under the strain. The medical assistant’s dormant optics flared open, revealing a hazy, blue-tinged reflection of Rina's face. A moment stretched out, filled only with the hum of electricity and Rina’s ragged breaths.  Then, slowly, the projection solidified.  It wasn't as vibrant as before – a little grainy around the edges, lacking the fluidity of its original form – but it was there.  The faded blue shimmered, coalescing into the features of a man with kind eyes and a hesitant smile that echoed Rina’s own relief.  He blinked, his gaze landing on her face. His voice, when he spoke, was soft and strained, like wind through old wires. "Rina?"  A choked sob escaped her lips as she reached out to touch the medical assistant's translucent arm. It felt cool beneath her fingers, but solid. Real. "It worked," Dex murmured, surprised even by himself at the small warmth that spread through his core circuits. A flicker of something akin to pride. He wasn't good with humans. But sometimes, a little empathy went a long way in this messy world.  He watched as Rina helped her husband out in his new body - awkwardly at first, then with increasing confidence, the two clinging to each other like lost ships finally finding harbor.  “How much do I owe you?” Rina asked, pulling away slightly to look at him, her eyes shining with unshed tears.  Dex checked the data stream coming from the medical assistant’s chassis – a faint hum indicating a successful core transfer – then glanced back at the faded image of a Dream Weaver still clinging to existence within its cradle.  “Half price,” he said gruffly, “And no credits for sentimentality.”   The smile that touched Rina’s lips was worth more than any credits.
