                       The Silence of the Spire

The void between galaxies is an abyss of profound silence, punctuated only by
the whisper of ancient photons and the low thrum of a ship’s life support.
Aboard the Terran Confederacy Star Surveyor Ares VII, that thrum was the only
constant for Captain Eva Rostova and her crew of four. They were fifty thousand
light-years from the nearest spiral arm, chasing a ghost – an anomalous
energy signature detected by a deep-space probe decades ago, dismissed as
sensor noise until it repeated, faintly, persistently, from the intergalactic
dark.  The Ares VII wasn't a warship or a colony vessel. She was a bloodhound,
built lean and fast, packed with sensors that could taste the quantum foam and
engines that folded space like origami. Her mission: find the source of the
signal, catalogue it, and report back. Simple on paper, terrifyingly lonely in
practice.  “Anything, Aris?” Eva asked, her voice calm, betraying none of
the gnawing isolation that came with staring into emptiness for months on end.
Her command chair, worn smooth in places, faced the main viewscreen, currently
displaying a starless black sprinkled with the impossibly distant smudges of
whole galaxies.  Dr. Aris Thorne, the ship’s lead xenophysicist and resident
fountain of cautious enthusiasm, adjusted the magnification on his console. His
brow furrowed, thinning grey hair catching the soft blue light. “Still
chasing ghosts, Captain. The signature is… elusive. It waxes and wanes, not
like a pulsar or quasar. And the energy profile is unlike anything in the
database. High-order neutrino cascades mixed with… well, frankly, Captain,
with things that shouldn’t exist according to standard models.”
“Meaning?” Eva prompted. She trusted Aris implicitly, but his tendency
towards theoretical physics sometimes needed grounding.  “Meaning it’s
either brand new physics, or it’s artificial,” Aris said, a thrill entering
his voice. “And given the coherence… I’m leaning heavily towards
artificial.”  Jax, the ship’s pilot, snorted from his station. He was
young, cocky, with reflexes honed by years in simulation and a few hairy
asteroid field navigations. “Artificial junk, maybe. Bet you it’s just some
Progenitor-era buoy that finally ran out of juice.” The Progenitors were the
favoured boogeymen of spacers – a hypothetical ancient race believed to have
seeded the galaxy, though no definitive proof had ever been found.
“Doubtful, Jax,” countered Lena Petrova, the Chief Engineer, her voice
gravelly over the internal comm. She rarely came to the bridge unless summoned
or bored, preferring the controlled chaos of her engine room. “The energy
levels, even attenuated over this distance, are orders of magnitude beyond
anything attributed to Progenitor tech signatures. This is different.”  Eva
nodded slowly. “Maintain course. Alert me the moment anything solidifies.”
Days turned into weeks. The Ares VII sliced through the void, its FTL drive
spooling down as they approached the calculated origin point. The silence

Days turned into weeks. The Ares VII sliced through the void, its FTL drive
spooling down as they approached the calculated origin point. The silence
deepened, the distant galactic smudges growing imperceptibly larger, yet
remaining fundamentally unreachable. Then, the signal flared. Not just a ghost,
but a beacon.

“Captain! On screen!” Aris’s voice cracked with excitement.

The viewscreen resolved. Against the utter blackness, something hung in the
void. It wasn’t a ship, not a planet, not a star. It was… structure.

Immense, impossibly vast, it stretched for hundreds of kilometers. It looked
like a shard of obsidian driven into the fabric of space, tapering to a point
so fine it seemed to vanish into infinity. Its surface wasn't smooth but
faceted, catching the faint, ambient light in ways that defied geometry. Lines
of faint, internal luminescence pulsed rhythmically within its dark mass, like
slow heartbeats. No emissions, no heat signature beyond the background
temperature, yet the energy Aris had tracked emanated from it, or perhaps
through it.

“Magnify sector Gamma-9,” Aris breathed, pointing a trembling finger.

The view zoomed. Near the base of the colossal structure, almost lost against
its scale, drifted another object. unmistakably artificial. A ship.

“Scan it,” Eva ordered, her voice tight.

The results were chilling. “Human configuration, Captain,” reported Ensign
Chen, the comms and sensor officer. “Older design, pre-Federation standard.
Heavy scarring… hull breaches… life support offline. No energy readings.
Cold and dead.”

Jax whistled low. “Someone beat us here. Didn’t end well for them.”

“Can we identify?” Eva asked.

“Transponder’s fried,” Chen replied, fingers flying across her console.
“Trying to match hull configuration… Standby… Possible match: Starseeker.
A long-range exploration vessel reported missing eighty standard years ago.
Vanished near the Perseus Veil.”

“Eighty years…” Aris murmured. “They couldn’t have reached this point
with the drives they had back then. Not unless…”

“Unless something brought them here?” Eva finished. Her eyes were fixed on
the silent, colossal spire. “Or they were drawn here, like us.”

A knot of apprehension tightened in Eva’s stomach. This wasn’t just
discovery; it was a potential graveyard. “Lena, status report. How are our
shields holding against the ambient energy?”

“Nominal, Captain,” Petrova’s voice came back, steady as ever. “The
field emanating from the… Spire… seems passive. High potential, but low
interaction. Like a coiled spring. I don’t like it.”

“Nobody does, Chief,” Eva said. “Aris, any indication of what this thing
is?”

“Hypotheses only,” Aris admitted, still captivated by the viewscreen. “A
construct of unimaginable scale. Its geometry seems… non-Euclidean in places.
The energy profile suggests it might be interacting with higher dimensions, or
perhaps manipulating spacetime directly. It’s not broadcasting, it’s…
resonating. Like a tuning fork struck aeons ago.”

“Could it be Progenitor?” Jax asked, his earlier cynicism replaced by awe.

Aris shook his head. “If it is, they were far beyond anything we’ve
imagined. This makes Progenitor artifacts look like children’s toys.”

Eva considered their options. Protocol demanded caution, observation from a
distance, reporting back. But the Starseeker floated there, a silent testament
to the potential danger and the magnitude of the discovery. And the Spire… it
called to the explorer in her, the part that had driven her to the stars in the
first place.

“Jax, take us in slowly. Maintain a distance of one hundred thousand
kilometers from the Spire. Chen, deploy a Class 3 probe towards the Starseeker.
Full sensor suite, passive scans only. Let’s see what happened to them before
we get any closer to that monolith.”

The small probe detached from the Ares VII, a silver dart against the black,
and accelerated towards the derelict ship. On the bridge, the crew watched its
telemetry, the silence punctuated only by Chen’s intermittent reports.

“Probe approaching the Starseeker… no defensive systems active… hull
damage consistent with weapon fire, but… unusual patterns. Crystallization
around the breach points.”

“Crystallization?” Aris leaned closer.

“Affirmative. Looks like… the hull material itself was transmuted. Scans
show non-standard isotopic ratios. Highly complex silicate structures.”

Images from the probe flashed onto a secondary screen. Jagged, crystalline
growths erupted from the torn edges of the Starseeker’s hull plating,
shimmering faintly even in the dim light. They weren't impact debris; they
looked almost organic, like coral grown on a wreck, but formed from the very
metal of the ship.

“Probe is attempting passive scan of the interior through hull breaches…”
Chen’s voice hitched. “Picking up… faint biological traces. Degraded.
Consistent with long-term vacuum exposure.”

A somber silence fell over the bridge. The crew of the Starseeker hadn’t
survived whatever encounter they’d had.

“Any logs? Data cores?” Eva asked quietly.

“Negative, Captain. Power core is dead cold. Looks like a massive energy
drain preceded the destruction. Something sucked them dry.”

Eva looked from the image of the crystalline corruption on the Starseeker to
the immense, silent Spire dominating the viewscreen. A connection sparked in
her mind, cold and unwelcome.

“Aris,” she said slowly. “Those energy cascades you mentioned… the
high-order neutrinos, the exotic particles…”

Aris’s eyes widened in understanding. “They could be byproducts of
mass-energy conversion on a colossal scale. Or… transmutation.”

“Like turning hull plating into complex crystals?”

“Precisely,” Aris breathed. “The Spire… it might not be inert. It might
be… feeding. Or processing.”

The implication hung heavy in the air. Processing what? Ships? Energy? Life?

“Probe is holding position,” Chen reported. “Awaiting further
instructions.”

“Recall the probe,” Eva ordered. “Maintain station. Lena, bring defensive
systems to full readiness. Shields at maximum, weapons capacitors charged.”

“Aye, Captain,” Petrova acknowledged, a new tension in her voice.

For hours, they watched. The Spire remained silent, impassive. The Starseeker
drifted, a tombstone in the void. The Ares VII hung back, a tiny mote of human
defiance in the face of overwhelming alienness.

“Captain,” Aris said suddenly, pointing at his console. “The resonance
field is changing. Subtly, but… it’s intensifying. And the frequency is
shifting, complexifying.”

On the main screen, the internal luminescence within the Spire seemed to pulse
faster, brighter. Faint, thread-like tendrils of light, barely visible, began
to extend from its faceted surface, reaching tentatively into the surrounding
space.

“Shields are registering increased particle impacts,” Chen reported, her
voice strained. “Exotic signatures, matching Dr. Thorne’s analysis.”

“Hold steady, Jax,” Eva commanded, gripping the arms of her chair. “Lena,
report any shield fluctuations.”

“Shields holding at ninety-eight percent,” Petrova said. “But the energy
transfer rate is climbing. It’s like it’s… tasting us.”

The tendrils of light grew bolder, stretching further. One drifted languidly
towards the distant Starseeker. As it made contact, the derelict ship
shimmered. The crystalline growths on its hull flared with an internal light,
pulsing in synchrony with the Spire.

“Energy spike from the Starseeker!” Chen yelled. “It’s resonating with
the Spire!”

“Get us out of here, Jax!” Eva snapped. “Emergency FTL prep! Lena, give
me everything you’ve got!”

“Spooling the drive now!” Jax wrestled with his controls. “ETA sixty
seconds!”

“Shields down to eighty percent!” Petrova shouted over the comm. “The
drain is exponential!”

More tendrils snaked out from the Spire, faster now, drawn by the Ares VII’s
sudden surge in power output for the FTL drive. They weren’t physical; they
passed through the outer hull, interacting directly with the ship’s energy
fields.

“FTL drive sequence initiated!” Jax announced.

“Forty percent shields!” Lena’s voice was tight with strain. “We’re
losing containment on the primary plasma conduits!”

“Compensate!” Eva ordered, her heart pounding.

A tendril, thicker and brighter than the others, slammed into the Ares VII. The
ship shuddered violently. Lights flickered, consoles sparked.

“Direct hit on the shield emitters!” Chen cried out. “Forward array is
offline!”

“Twenty percent!” Petrova yelled. “Hull integrity failing near the engine
nacelles! I’m seeing… crystallization!”

On a damage control monitor, Eva saw it – the same sinister, shimmering
crystal growth erupting from the ship’s metal skin near the engines,
spreading like frost.

“Aris!” Eva shouted. “What is this thing doing?!”

Aris Thorne was pale, his eyes wide with a terrifying awe. “It’s not
attacking… it’s assimilating! Converting energy, matter… integrating it
into its own structure! The Starseeker wasn’t destroyed, Captain, it was…
consumed. Digested!”

“Ten seconds to jump!” Jax counted down, sweat beading on his forehead.

“Main power failing!” Lena screamed. “The crystallization is spreading to
the conduits! Five seconds!”

The ship groaned around them, the sound of tortured metal. The lights died,
plunging the bridge into emergency red lighting. The viewscreen flickered,
showing the Spire looming impossibly large, its internal light blazing.

“Three!”

“Two!”

“We’re not going to make it!” Lena’s voice was laced with despair.

“Override!” Eva slammed her fist on the command console override panel.
“Jettison the port nacelle! Now, Lena!”

There was a half-second hesitation. Jettisoning an engine nacelle during FTL
spool-up was suicidally dangerous, potentially tearing the ship apart.

“Do it!” Eva roared.

“Jettison the port nacelle! Now, Lena!”

There was a half-second hesitation. Jettisoning an engine nacelle during FTL
spool-up was suicidally dangerous, potentially tearing the ship apart.

“Do it!” Eva roared.

A deafening explosion rocked the Ares VII. The ship bucked like a dying beast.
On the flickering viewscreen, the port engine nacelle, already covered in the
parasitic crystal, tore away in a flash of plasma and disintegrating metal.

“One!” Jax screamed.

The crystal growth, momentarily drawn to the sudden, massive energy release of
the jettisoned nacelle, retracted fractionally from the main hull.

“JUMP!”

Reality twisted. The Spire vanished from the viewscreen, replaced by the
nauseating, kaleidoscopic smear of hyperspace. The Ares VII, crippled and
trailing debris, tore itself away from the intergalactic void.

Silence returned, broken only by the ragged gasps of the crew and the insistent
blare of damage alarms. The emergency lights cast long, dancing shadows on the
bridge.

“Status…” Eva choked out, her voice hoarse.

“We’re… we’re in FTL,” Jax stammered, wiping sweat from his eyes.
“But the trajectory is unstable. We jumped blind.”

“Starboard engine holding,” Lena reported, her voice shaky but professional
again. “Port nacelle gone. Hull breaches contained, but structural integrity
is compromised across decks five through nine. Life support is stable. Power at
forty percent. The crystallization… it stopped the moment we entered
hyperspace.”

Chen checked her console. “No sign of pursuit. We’re clear.”

Aris Thorne slumped back in his chair, staring blankly at his dark console.
“Consumed…” he whispered. “It wasn’t malice. It was… process. Like
a star consuming hydrogen. We were just… fuel.”

Eva took a deep, shuddering breath, the adrenaline leaving her weak. She looked
around the ravaged bridge, at her pale, stunned crew. They were alive.
Crippled, lost, billions of light-years from any conceivable help, but alive.

“Lena,” she said, finding her command voice again. “Can we stabilize the
FTL? Can we navigate?”

“It’ll be rough, Captain,” Petrova replied. “Without the port nacelle,
balance is shot. We’ll have micro-jumps and recalculations constantly.
Efficiency is maybe ten percent. Getting home…” She didn’t need to finish
the sentence. Getting home would take decades, if they made it at all.

“Plot a course for the nearest charted system, Lena. Any system. We need a
baseline.” Eva stood up, wobbly but resolute. “Chen, prepare a data packet.
Everything we recorded. The Spire, the Starseeker, the crystallization,
Aris’s analysis. Encrypt it, triple redundancy. We’ll broadcast it on all
subspace frequencies the moment we exit FTL, before we try another jump.”

“Captain,” Aris said, looking up, his eyes haunted. “That thing… the
Spire… it’s still out there. Growing? Waiting? What do we tell people? What
does this mean?”

Eva walked to the auxiliary viewscreen, which now showed only the swirling
chaos of hyperspace. She thought of the silent, colossal structure, the
consumed Starseeker, the crystalline blight that had almost claimed them.
Humanity had always looked to the stars with wonder, dreaming of connection, of
finding others like themselves. They had found something. But it wasn't like
them at all. It was vast, ancient, and utterly, terrifyingly alien. Its motives
were as inscrutable as the void itself, its existence a challenge to everything
humanity thought it knew.

“We tell them the truth, Aris,” Eva said softly, her gaze distant. “We
tell them the universe is infinitely larger and stranger than we ever imagined.
We tell them there are things in the dark between galaxies… and they are
hungry.”

She turned back to her crew, her face set. “Alright. Let’s figure out how
to get this wreck moving. We have a warning to deliver.”

The Ares VII, battered and broken, plunged onward through the unreal landscape
of hyperspace, carrying a message of terrifying discovery, a testament to
survival against cosmic indifference. The silence of the Spire remained behind
them, a monument of alien purpose in the vast, uncaring dark, waiting. The long
journey home had just begun.ke a dying beast. On the flickering viewscreen, the
port engine nacelle, already covered in the parasitic crystal, tore away in a

“But the trajectory is unstable. We jumped blind.”

“Starboard engine holding,” Lena reported, her voice shaky but professional
again. “Port nacelle gone. Hull breaches contained, but structural integrity
is compromised across decks five through nine. Life support is stable. Power at
forty percent. The crystallization… it stopped the moment we entered
hyperspace.”

Chen checked her console. “No sign of pursuit. We’re clear.”

Aris Thorne slumped back in his chair, staring blankly at his dark console.
“Consumed…” he whispered. “It wasn’t malice. It was… process. Like
a star consuming hydrogen. We were just… fuel.”

Eva took a deep, shuddering breath, the adrenaline leaving her weak. She looked
around the ravaged bridge, at her pale, stunned crew. They were alive.
Crippled, lost, billions of light-years from any conceivable help, but alive.

“Lena,” she said, finding her command voice again. “Can we stabilize the
FTL? Can we navigate?”

“It’ll be rough, Captain,” Petrova replied. “Without the port nacelle,
balance is shot. We’ll have micro-jumps and recalculations constantly.
Efficiency is maybe ten percent. Getting home…” She didn’t need to finish
the sentence. Getting home would take decades, if they made it at all.

“Plot a course for the nearest charted system, Lena. Any system. We need a
baseline.” Eva stood up, wobbly but resolute. “Chen, prepare a data packet.
Everything we recorded. The Spire, the Starseeker, the crystallization,
Aris’s analysis. Encrypt it, triple redundancy. We’ll broadcast it on all
subspace frequencies the moment we exit FTL, before we try another jump.”

“Captain,” Aris said, looking up, his eyes haunted. “That thing… the
Spire… it’s still out there. Growing? Waiting? What do we tell people? What
does this mean?”

Eva walked to the auxiliary viewscreen, which now showed only the swirling
chaos of hyperspace. She thought of the silent, colossal structure, the
consumed Starseeker, the crystalline blight that had almost claimed them.
Humanity had always looked to the stars with wonder, dreaming of connection, of
finding others like themselves. They had found something. But it wasn't like
them at all. It was vast, ancient, and utterly, terrifyingly alien. Its motives
were as inscrutable as the void itself, its existence a challenge to everything
humanity thought it knew.

“We tell them the truth, Aris,” Eva said softly, her gaze distant. “We
tell them the universe is infinitely larger and stranger than we ever imagined.
We tell them there are things in the dark between galaxies… and they are
hungry.”

She turned back to her crew, her face set. “Alright. Let’s figure out how
to get this wreck moving. We have a warning to deliver.”

The Ares VII, battered and broken, plunged onward through the unreal landscape
of hyperspace, carrying a message of terrifying discovery, a testament to
survival against cosmic indifference. The silence of the Spire remained behind
them, a monument of alien purpose in the vast, uncaring dark, waiting. The long
journey home had just begun.able. Then, the signal flared. Not just a ghost,
but a beacon.
“Captain! On screen!” Aris’s voice cracked with excitement.
The viewscreen resolved. Against the utter blackness, something hung in the
void. It wasn’t a ship, not a planet, not a star. It was… structure.
Immense, impossibly vast, it stretched for hundreds of kilometers. It looked
like a shard of obsidian driven into the fabric of space, tapering to a point
so fine it seemed to vanish into infinity. Its surface wasn't smooth but
faceted, catching the faint, ambient light in ways that defied geometry. Lines
of faint, internal luminescence pulsed rhythmically within its dark mass, like
slow heartbeats. No emissions, no heat signature beyond the background
temperature, yet the energy Aris had tracked emanated from it, or perhaps
through it.
“Magnify sector Gamma-9,” Aris breathed, pointing a trembling finger.
The view zoomed. Near the base of the colossal structure, almost lost against
its scale, drifted another object. unmistakably artificial. A ship.
“Scan it,” Eva ordered, her voice tight.
The results were chilling. “Human configuration, Captain,” reported Ensign
Chen, the comms and sensor officer. “Older design, pre-Federation standard.
Heavy scarring… hull breaches… life support offline. No energy readings.
Cold and dead.”
Jax whistled low. “Someone beat us here. Didn’t end well for them.”
“Can we identify?” Eva asked.
“Transponder’s fried,” Chen replied, fingers flying across her console.
“Trying to match hull configuration… Standby… Possible match: Starseeker.
A long-range exploration vessel reported missing eighty standard years ago.
Vanished near the Perseus Veil.”
“Eighty years…” Aris murmured. “They couldn’t have reached this point
with the drives they had back then. Not unless…”
“Unless something brought them here?” Eva finished. Her eyes were fixed on
the silent, colossal spire. “Or they were drawn here, like us.”
A knot of apprehension tightened in Eva’s stomach. This wasn’t just
discovery; it was a potential graveyard. “Lena, status report. How are our
shields holding against the ambient energy?”
“Nominal, Captain,” Petrova’s voice came back, steady as ever. “The
field emanating from the… Spire… seems passive. High potential, but low
interaction. Like a coiled spring. I don’t like it.”
“Nobody does, Chief,” Eva said. “Aris, any indication of what this thing
is?”
“Hypotheses only,” Aris admitted, still captivated by the viewscreen. “A
construct of unimaginable scale. Its geometry seems… non-Euclidean in places.
The energy profile suggests it might be interacting with higher dimensions, or
perhaps manipulating spacetime directly. It’s not broadcasting, it’s…
resonating. Like a tuning fork struck aeons ago.”
“Could it be Progenitor?” Jax asked, his earlier cynicism replaced by awe.
Aris shook his head. “If it is, they were far beyond anything we’ve
imagined. This makes Progenitor artifacts look like children’s toys.”
Eva considered their options. Protocol demanded caution, observation from a
distance, reporting back. But the Starseeker floated there, a silent testament
to the potential danger and the magnitude of the discovery. And the Spire… it
called to the explorer in her, the part that had driven her to the stars in the
first place.
“Jax, take us in slowly. Maintain a distance of one hundred thousand
kilometers from the Spire. Chen, deploy a Class 3 probe towards the Starseeker.
Full sensor suite, passive scans only. Let’s see what happened to them before
we get any closer to that monolith.”
The small probe detached from the Ares VII, a silver dart against the black,
and accelerated towards the derelict ship. On the bridge, the crew watched its
telemetry, the silence punctuated only by Chen’s intermittent reports.
“Probe approaching the Starseeker… no defensive systems active… hull
damage consistent with weapon fire, but… unusual patterns. Crystallization
around the breach points.”
“Crystallization?” Aris leaned closer.
“Affirmative. Looks like… the hull material itself was transmuted. Scans
show non-standard isotopic ratios. Highly complex silicate structures.”
Images from the probe flashed onto a secondary screen. Jagged, crystalline
growths erupted from the torn edges of the Starseeker’s hull plating,
shimmering faintly even in the dim light. They weren't impact debris; they
looked almost organic, like coral grown on a wreck, but formed from the very
metal of the ship.
“Probe is attempting passive scan of the interior through hull breaches…”
Chen’s voice hitched. “Picking up… faint biological traces. Degraded.
Consistent with long-term vacuum exposure.”
A somber silence fell over the bridge. The crew of the Starseeker hadn’t
survived whatever encounter they’d had.
“Any logs? Data cores?” Eva asked quietly.
“Negative, Captain. Power core is dead cold. Looks like a massive energy
drain preceded the destruction. Something sucked them dry.”
Eva looked from the image of the crystalline corruption on the Starseeker to
the immense, silent Spire dominating the viewscreen. A connection sparked in
her mind, cold and unwelcome.
“Aris,” she said slowly. “Those energy cascades you mentioned… the
high-order neutrinos, the exotic particles…”
Aris’s eyes widened in understanding. “They could be byproducts of
mass-energy conversion on a colossal scale. Or… transmutation.”
“Like turning hull plating into complex crystals?”
“Precisely,” Aris breathed. “The Spire… it might not be inert. It might
be… feeding. Or processing.”
The implication hung heavy in the air. Processing what? Ships? Energy? Life?
“Probe is holding position,” Chen reported. “Awaiting further
instructions.”
“Recall the probe,” Eva ordered. “Maintain station. Lena, bring defensive
systems to full readiness. Shields at maximum, weapons capacitors charged.”
“Aye, Captain,” Petrova acknowledged, a new tension in her voice.
For hours, they watched. The Spire remained silent, impassive. The Starseeker
drifted, a tombstone in the void. The Ares VII hung back, a tiny mote of human
defiance in the face of overwhelming alienness.
“Captain,” Aris said suddenly, pointing at his console. “The resonance
field is changing. Subtly, but… it’s intensifying. And the frequency is
shifting, complexifying.”
On the main screen, the internal luminescence within the Spire seemed to pulse
faster, brighter. Faint, thread-like tendrils of light, barely visible, began
to extend from its faceted surface, reaching tentatively into the surrounding
space.
“Shields are registering increased particle impacts,” Chen reported, her
voice strained. “Exotic signatures, matching Dr. Thorne’s analysis.”
“Hold steady, Jax,” Eva commanded, gripping the arms of her chair. “Lena,
report any shield fluctuations.”
“Shields holding at ninety-eight percent,” Petrova said. “But the energy
transfer rate is climbing. It’s like it’s… tasting us.”
The tendrils of light grew bolder, stretching further. One drifted languidly
towards the distant Starseeker. As it made contact, the derelict ship
shimmered. The crystalline growths on its hull flared with an internal light,
pulsing in synchrony with the Spire.
“Energy spike from the Starseeker!” Chen yelled. “It’s resonating with
the Spire!”
“Get us out of here, Jax!” Eva snapped. “Emergency FTL prep! Lena, give
me everything you’ve got!”
“Spooling the drive now!” Jax wrestled with his controls. “ETA sixty
seconds!”
“Shields down to eighty percent!” Petrova shouted over the comm. “The
drain is exponential!”
More tendrils snaked out from the Spire, faster now, drawn by the Ares VII’s
sudden surge in power output for the FTL drive. They weren’t physical; they
passed through the outer hull, interacting directly with the ship’s energy
fields.
“FTL drive sequence initiated!” Jax announced.
“Forty percent shields!” Lena’s voice was tight with strain. “We’re
losing containment on the primary plasma conduits!”
“Compensate!” Eva ordered, her heart pounding.
A tendril, thicker and brighter than the others, slammed into the Ares VII. The
ship shuddered violently. Lights flickered, consoles sparked.
“Direct hit on the shield emitters!” Chen cried out. “Forward array is
offline!”
“Twenty percent!” Petrova yelled. “Hull integrity failing near the engine
nacelles! I’m seeing… crystallization!”
On a damage control monitor, Eva saw it – the same sinister, shimmering
crystal growth erupting from the ship’s metal skin near the engines,
spreading like frost.
“Aris!” Eva shouted. “What is this thing doing?!”
Aris Thorne was pale, his eyes wide with a terrifying awe. “It’s not
attacking… it’s assimilating! Converting energy, matter… integrating it
into its own structure! The Starseeker wasn’t destroyed, Captain, it was…
consumed. Digested!”
“Ten seconds to jump!” Jax counted down, sweat beading on his forehead.
“Main power failing!” Lena screamed. “The crystallization is spreading to
the conduits! Five seconds!”
The ship groaned around them, the sound of tortured metal. The lights died,
plunging the bridge into emergency red lighting. The viewscreen flickered,
showing the Spire looming impossibly large, its internal light blazing.
“Three!”
“Two!”
“We’re not going to make it!” Lena’s voice was laced with despair.
“Override!” Eva slammed her fist on the command console override panel.
“Jettison the port nacelle! Now, Lena!”
There was a half-second hesitation. Jettisoning an engine nacelle during FTL
spool-up was suicidally dangerous, potentially tearing the ship apart.
“Do it!” Eva roared.
A deafening explosion rocked the Ares VII. The ship bucked like a dying beast.
On the flickering viewscreen, the port engine nacelle, already covered in the
parasitic crystal, tore away in a flash of plasma and disintegrating metal.
“One!” Jax screamed.
The crystal growth, momentarily drawn to the sudden, massive energy release of
the jettisoned nacelle, retracted fractionally from the main hull.
“JUMP!”
Reality twisted. The Spire vanished from the viewscreen, replaced by the
nauseating, kaleidoscopic smear of hyperspace. The Ares VII, crippled and
trailing debris, tore itself away from the intergalactic void.
Silence returned, broken only by the ragged gasps of the crew and the insistent
blare of damage alarms. The emergency lights cast long, dancing shadows on the
bridge.
“Status…” Eva choked out, her voice hoarse.
“We’re… we’re in FTL,” Jax stammered, wiping sweat from his eyes.
“But the trajectory is unstable. We jumped blind.”

journey home had just begun.
