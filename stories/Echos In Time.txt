                                 by Norsiwel

The hum of the city was a familiar lullaby to Dr. Angela Herrera as she walked home from work. The late afternoon sun painted the skyscrapers in hues of rose and gold, reflecting off the pristine glass facades that lined her route. It was a picture of urban tranquility, a testament to the city's prosperity and peace. Angela loved these quiet moments, a brief respite before settling into the routine of her evening. She turned onto her street, the familiar brownstone apartment building just a block away. As she did, the world fractured.  A blinding flash of light, brighter than any sun, seared across the sky. The hum of the city died, replaced by a high-pitched whine that vibrated through the very bones in her body. Before she could even register what was happening, the ground trembled beneath her feet, throwing her off balance. A shockwave, like a physical blow, slammed into her, sending her stumbling. She reached out, grabbing onto a nearby lamppost for support, just as a section of the street buckled and cracked.  Looking up, Angela saw it. A colossal, metallic sphere, impossibly large, hung suspended in the air above the city. Its surface shimmered, reflecting the dying sunlight in a thousand blinding glints. From its underside, beams of energy, like shimmering ribbons of light, lanced down towards the city, striking buildings and turning them instantly into plumes of smoke and dust. The whine intensified, becoming a deafening roar. The air crackled with an energy that made her skin crawl.  Panic seized the city. Screams echoed through the streets as people poured out of buildings, running in every direction. Cars swerved erratically, horns blaring, trying to navigate the chaos. But there was nowhere to run. The sphere was everywhere, a silent, menacing presence that dominated the sky.Angela, still clinging to the lamppost, felt a sharp sting on her arm. Looking down, she saw a thin line of blood welling up from a cut. A shard of glass, propelled by the shockwave, had sliced through her skin. The pain was a sharp reminder of her own vulnerability. This wasn't a dream, or some kind of elaborate special effect. This was real. Another beam of energy struck a building just a few blocks away. The explosion was deafening. The ground shook violently, throwing Angela to her knees. A wave of heat washed over her, scorching her skin. She scrambled to her feet, adrenaline coursing through her veins. She had to get out of here.  Running as fast as her legs could carry her, Angela headed towards her apartment building. The streets were a scene of utter devastation. Buildings were crumbling, fires raged, and debris rained down from the sky. A car, its front end crushed, sat abandoned in the middle of the road. Smoke billowed from a shattered storefront, the mannequins inside now coated in a layer of ash. She dodged falling rubble, narrowly avoiding being crushed by a collapsing wall...The heat was intense, the air thick with smoke and dust. It was a nightmare made real. As she reached the entrance to her building, another beam of energy flashed past, striking the street just a few feet away. The force of the blast threw her forward, slamming her against the building's wall. She gasped for breath, her lungs burning. Looking up, she saw that the entrance to her building was blocked by a pile of rubble. She was trapped.  Desperation clawed at her. She couldn't stay here. She had to find a way out. Ignoring the pain in her arm and the ringing in her ears, she began to climb over the rubble, pulling herself up with her hands and knees. Glass crunched beneath her feet. She could feel more cuts opening up on her skin, but she didn't care. She had to get inside.  Finally, she managed to scramble over the pile of debris and stumbled into the lobby of her building. It was dark and eerily silent. The lights had gone out, and the only sound was the distant roar of the alien attack. She leaned against the wall, catching her breath. She was safe, for now.  Making her way to the elevator, she pressed the button for her floor. Nothing happened. The power was out. Sighing, she headed for the stairwell. Each step was an agony, her body screaming in protest. But she kept going, driven by a primal instinct to survive.  Finally, she reached her apartment door. She fumbled for her keys, her hands shaking. The door swung open, and she stepped inside, collapsing onto the floor. The silence of her apartment was a stark contrast to the chaos outside. She lay there for a moment, catching her breath, trying to process what had just happened.  The attack had come without warning, shattering the illusion of peace and safety. Her city, her home, was under attack by an unknown enemy. She had no idea what they wanted, or why they were here. All she knew was that her life had just changed forever.  Getting to her feet, Angela locked the door and headed for the bathroom. She needed to clean her wounds and assess the damage. As she looked at her reflection in the mirror, she barely recognized herself. Her face was covered in dust and grime, her hair matted with sweat. Her eyes were wide with fear and shock. She looked like a survivor, a refugee from a war she didn't understand.  She cleaned her cuts, wincing as she applied antiseptic. Her arm was throbbing, but it didn't appear to be seriously injured. She wrapped it in a bandage, then went to the kitchen to find something to eat and drink. Her stomach was churning, but she knew she needed to keep her strength up.  As she ate, she thought about what she should do next. She couldn't stay here. The building could be attacked at any moment. She needed to find a safer place to go, somewhere she could wait out the attack and figure out what was happening.  But where could she go? The city was a warzone. Everywhere was dangerous. She didn't have any family or close friends in the city. She was alone.   The silence of her apartment was a stark contrast to the chaos outside. She lay there for a moment, catching her breath, trying to process what had just happened. The attack had come without warning, shattering the illusion of peace and safety. Her city, her home, was under attack by an unknown enemy. She had no idea what they wanted, or why they were here. All she knew was that her life had just changed forever. A tremor shook the building, a distant rumble that sent a fresh wave of fear through her. This wasn't just a random attack; it felt… targeted. A horrifying thought crept into her mind. What if it's connected to Echelon? What if her tampering with the system had somehow triggered this? The timing was too coincidental. She remembered the younger version of herself, the warning about disrupting communication with other species. Entire timelines are unraveling because of what you did. The words echoed in her mind. She had to know. She had to find out if she was responsible for this. Her gaze fell on the temporal communicator.   It wasn't just a means of escape; it was a way to find answers. It was a way to potentially fix this. She couldn't stay here, cowering in her apartment, waiting for the inevitable. She had to act.   She activated her portable power supply, thinking that she had made the right decision in spending the money for it, because she realized that without it, she’d have no options, how strange it was that a little thing like that might be saving her life, and perhaps much more.  Taking a deep breath, Angela picked up the communicator…Taking a deep breath.  She knew it was a risk, but it was a risk she had to take. She had to try to save her city, even if it meant risking her own life. She activated the device. The familiar blue light flickered to life, bathing the room in an ethereal glow. Her fingers flew across the interface, setting the temporal coordinates – the date and time of her last interaction with Echelon. A low hum filled the room, growing in intensity until it vibrated through the floor. The air crackled, and a strange tingling sensation spread through her body. The world around her began to blur, the walls of her apartment dissolving into streaks of light and color. It was like being pulled through a tunnel, a vortex of time and space. Then, just as suddenly as it began, the sensation stopped. The light faded, and the world snapped back into focus.   Outside, the city sprawled endlessly, a labyrinth of neon lights and towering skyscrapers that hummed with life. But inside, the room was silent except for the faint whirring of machinery and the soft glow of her temporal communicator—a device she hadn’t touched in seven years.  Seven years ago, she had traveled to the past and  tried to fix the world’s economy. She had thought herself a savior, armed with Echelon, the most advanced artificial intelligence ever created. It wasn’t just designed to stabilize markets; it was humanity’s first attempt at communicating with alien civilizations. At least, that’s what they told her when she signed on to the project.   But now, as she stared at the blinking alert on her communicator, the weight of her choices pressed down like an invisible hand squeezing her chest. Her meddling hadn’t fixed anything—it had broken everything. The ripples of her actions had spread across time, fracturing realities she couldn’t even comprehend. And now, it seemed, those fractures were catching up to her.  A chime rang through the quiet, sharp and insistent. Her communicator pulsed brighter, demanding attention. Hesitantly, she reached out and activated the call. A younger version of herself appeared—a flickering hologram standing in the corner of the room, her expression taut with worry.  "Dr. Herrera," the hologram said, her voice trembling slightly. "You have to come back. Our future is falling apart."  Angela frowned, leaning forward. "Tell me why, younger me."  The hologram hesitated, as if searching for the right words. "Echelon... it wasn’t just about money. That was only part of it. You don’t understand—you meddled with something far bigger than you realized. Your interference didn’t just alter numbers. It disrupted our ability to communicate with other species. Entire timelines are unraveling because of what you did."  Angela felt a cold knot tighten in her stomach. She’d believed she was fixing mistakes, undoing the damage caused by reckless economic policies. Was she the mistake? Had her good intentions led to this catastrophe?  Before she could respond, the hologram vanished, leaving her alone with the oppressive silence of her apartment. Her mind raced. She had two options: stay here, letting time continue to unravel, or return to the past and confront the consequences of her actions. There was no question, really. She couldn’t sit idly by while worlds—both human and alien—collapsed under the weight of her hubris.  She stepped into her time machine, a sleek pod-like structure tucked away in the corner of her lab-turned-apartment. The machine hummed to life, its metallic surface glowing faintly as it prepared to send her back seven years. As the countdown began, Angela closed her eyes, bracing herself for what lay ahead. When the machine whirred and spat her out into the past, she found herself standing once again in her old laboratory.  The air smelled of burnt wires and ozone, a scent she hadn’t realized she missed until now. Younger Angela sat hunched over a massive console, her brow furrowed in concentration. Echelon loomed behind her, a towering construct of circuits and screens, pulsating with energy. This was where it all began—and where it would end, one way or another.  "Who are you?" Younger Angela asked sharply, turning to face the intruder. Her eyes narrowed suspiciously. "How did you get in here?"  Angela took a deep breath, stepping closer. "I’m you," she said softly, placing a hand on her younger self’s shoulder. "Seven years older. We need to talk about Echelon."  Younger Angela recoiled, disbelief written across her features. "What kind of joke is this? Save it? Do you know how close we came to disaster last week? If I hadn’t shut it down when I did—"  "You didn’t shut it down soon enough," Angela interrupted, her tone firm but gentle. "And neither did I. Listen to me. Echelon isn’t just about stabilizing economies. It’s humanity’s first step toward talking to the stars. But my interference messed that up. I came back to make things right."  Younger Angela crossed her arms, skepticism etched into every line of her body. "Talk to the stars? That’s insane. No one told me anything about aliens."  "That’s because they didn’t want to scare you," Angela replied. "They wanted you focused on the immediate problem—the collapsing global economy. But there’s so much more at stake here. Look at the data streams." She gestured to the monitors surrounding them. Patterns danced across the screens, complex algorithms interspersed with strange, rhythmic pulses.  Alien signals.  Younger Angela froze, staring at the display. "What… what am I looking at?"    "First Contact Protocol," Angela explained. "It’s buried deep within Echelon’s code. They embedded it as a failsafe, a way to ensure humanity wouldn’t isolate itself from the rest of the universe. But when I tampered with the system, I disrupted those signals. Now, entire timelines are collapsing because of it."  Younger Angela’s skepticism began to melt into awe. "So that’s why you came back."  "Not just to explain," Angela said, her voice steady. "To help you finish what we started. Together, we can restore Echelon and repair the damage I caused. But we have to do it carefully. Time can’t be controlled—it can only be understood."  As they worked side by side, the holographic interface flickered unpredictably, displaying fragments of alternate futures. In one, cities burned as panicked crowds fled unseen horrors. In another, humanity stood united beneath a sky filled with alien ships, their lights shimmering like stars come to Earth. These visions fueled their determination, driving them to complete the task before them.  Finally, after hours of feverish effort, the machine glowed brightly, humming with renewed purpose. A hidden message scrolled across the main screen: "First Contact Protocol:  Initiating."  Younger Angela turned to her older counterpart, her eyes wide with wonder. "We did it."  Angela nodded, a calm spreading through her. For the first time in years, she felt at peace. Redemption wasn’t about erasing mistakes—it was about learning from them. Sometimes, you had to let time take its course, trusting that the lessons of the past would guide the future.  With a final glance at Echelon, Angela stepped back into her time machine. As the pod whirred to life, she allowed herself a moment to reflect. Whatever awaited her in her own time, she was ready. She knew now that true change came not from controlling destiny, but from embracing it.  When she returned to her era, the world felt different. The skies above the city shimmered faintly, as if holding secrets too vast to comprehend. News reports spoke of strange phenomena—unexplained lights in the heavens, whispers of contact with beings beyond human understanding.  Humanity had taken its first steps toward joining the galactic community, thanks to the efforts of two versions of the same woman. Angela smiled, gazing out at the horizon. The echoes of time still lingered, but they no longer haunted her. Instead, they reminded her of the infinite possibilities waiting to unfold. As she watched, a single, shimmering beam of light descended from the sky, not the destructive energy of before, but a soft, pulsating glow. It landed in a nearby park, and from it emerged… something. Not a monstrous invader, but a tall, slender figure, radiating an aura of peace. The figure raised a hand, and a voice, not in words, but in pure thought, resonated in Angela’s mind, and, she suspected, in the minds of everyone on Earth. We are here. We have heard you. Our initial contact was…misunderstood.   Angela felt the wave of emotion – relief, wonder, connection. The attack, the fear, the devastation – it hadn't been malice, but a cosmic miscommunication. Humanity, in its isolation, had misinterpreted a reaching hand as a fist.  As the alien figure stood in the park, radiating an aura of peaceful curiosity, Angela didn't just watch.  A sense of purpose settled within her, solid and undeniable.  She had inadvertently played a part in this near-catastrophe, and now, she felt compelled to be part of the bridge to a better future.  Taking a slow, deliberate breath, Angela began to walk towards the park. Each step was a commitment, a quiet answer to the silent greeting that echoed in her mind. The city around her was still scarred, sirens wailed distantly, and smoke still painted streaks across the twilight sky. But amidst the damage, people were emerging from shelters, drawn by the impossible sight in the park.  There was fear in their eyes, yes, but also a hesitant wonder, a dawning comprehension that something momentous was unfolding.  As she approached the park's edge, she could see the alien figure more clearly. It wasn’t imposing or frightening up close, but elegant, almost ethereal.  Its form was vaguely humanoid, but with subtle differences that spoke of a different world, a different evolution.  It turned its head, or what seemed to be its head, in her direction as she walked closer, and Angela felt a wave of gentle curiosity emanating from it, like a soft breeze.  Reaching the edge of the park, Angela stopped a respectful distance away. She raised her hand slowly, palm open, in a gesture she hoped conveyed peace, an echo of the openness she now felt in her heart.  She focused her thoughts, directing them outward, a clumsy, human attempt at the non-verbal communication she now understood was possible.  Hello, she projected, the thought feeling fragile and uncertain as it left her mind. We… we understand now. We are sorry for our fear.  The alien figure remained still for a moment, and then, mirrored her gesture.  It raised a slender hand, and from it, a soft, warm light pulsed outwards, enveloping Angela in a gentle embrace.  In that light, she felt not just understanding, but acceptance.  A profound sense of connection that transcended words, transcended species.  And then, a new thought resonated, clearer now, stronger, filling not just her mind, but seeming to bloom in the air itself, for everyone to hear, to feel: We are here to learn. And to share. The echoes of time have brought us together. Let us listen to them, and build a future of understanding.  Angela stood there, bathed in the alien light, tears welling in her eyes, not of fear or regret, but of profound hope.  Around her, she saw others in the park mirroring her stance, reaching out, tentatively, towards the figure.  The city was broken, but the silence that followed the alien’s message was not one of fear, but of stunned, hopeful anticipation.  The future was indeed uncertain, vastly so, but it was no longer a future defined by fear of the unknown.  It was a future pregnant with possibility, a shared future, echoing with the promise of understanding and connection across the vast expanse of time and space.
