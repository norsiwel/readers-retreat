In The Beginning
by Norsiwel


The world was young then, a vibrant tapestry woven with raw, untamed threads. Colossal trees, their leaves like emerald sails, reached for a sky that blazed with a fiery, untamed sun. Rivers, like ribbons of liquid silver, snaked through valleys carpeted in thick, untamed grasses, teeming with life that was both beautiful and perilous. The air hummed with the constant symphony of the wild - the rustling of leaves, the chirping of insects, the distant roar of beasts that roamed the shadows. It was a time when the line between man and nature was blurred, when survival depended on instinct, and when the world held its breath, waiting for the unfolding of its own grand story. In this primordial cradle, a story of an unlikely companionship was about to take root, as Og, a man of the earth, met Sniff, a creature of the wild.
The wind, a playful sprite, tousled the tall grasses as Og, a man of simple wants and even simpler vocabulary, grunted at the sky. The sun beat down, turning the world into a shimmering haze, and Og, armed with a pointy stick and an even pointier frown, was not having a good day. He’d chased a particularly plump rabbit all morning, only to watch it vanish into the earth, leaving him with an empty stomach and a simmering frustration. As he slumped beneath the shade of a gnarled tree, a pathetic whimpering reached his ears. It was a scrawny, mud-caked creature, its fur a tangled mess, and eyes wide with a mix of fear and cautious curiosity. It was a dog, though Og had never seen anything like it. He poked it tentatively with his stick. "Thing," he declared, not knowing what else to call it. The creature flinched but didn't run.  Og, despite his gruff exterior, felt a flicker of something akin to pity. He had, after all, been the recipient of pity himself once or twice. He reached into his pouch, extracting a piece of dried meat that he had been saving for a moment of extreme desperation, and tossed it toward the “thing”.  The creature devoured it in a heartbeat, its tail thumping weakly against the ground.  A slow, hesitant dance began. Og, intrigued by the creature’s persistence, began to share his meager meals. The dog, in return, began to offer something unexpected: companionship. It would follow Og, its tail wagging with a fervor that defied its thin frame. It would lay its head on Og’s lap as he rested, a silent, comforting presence. Og, who’d always lived a solitary life, found an odd comfort in this new arrangement. He started to call it “Sniff,” because it sniffed at everything.  One day, while Og was fumbling with a particularly stubborn piece of firewood, Sniff nudged his hand, then barked once, twice, leading him to a pile of dry kindling hidden beneath a bush.  Og stared at Sniff, a spark of understanding igniting in his eyes. This wasn’t just a “thing.” This was a partner.  The bond between man and dog had been forged in shared meals, mutual need, and a quiet understanding that transcended words. The world, once a place of lonely hunts and empty nights, was now a place of shared adventures, playful chases, and warm companionship.  Sniff became Og’s shadow, a constant companion through sun and rain. And Og, in turn, offered Sniff his loyalty and protection.  One evening, huddled close to the fire, Og looked at Sniff, a rare smile softening his features. He patted Sniff’s head, a gesture of affection that was both awkward and profound. “Good thing,” Og grunted. And Sniff, with a happy woof, licked Og’s hand, confirming a truth that was already etched in the stars; a relationship that would forever change the world.
       The air hung thick and heavy with the scent of damp earth and blooming honeysuckle, a fragrant cloak draped over the dawn-kissed valley. It was a time of subtle magic, when the world seemed to hold its breath between one age and the next. Og and Sniff, their bond now as solid as the ancient stones that dotted the landscape, were indeed living in a very special time. The days were no longer just about survival; they were filled with the small joys of shared existence, a dance between two souls that were becoming increasingly intertwined. They'd developed a rhythm, a silent language spoken in nudges, barks, and knowing glances. The forest, once a place of challenge, now felt like a playground. Og would laugh, a deep, rumbling sound that startled the birds, as Sniff chased butterflies with comical enthusiasm.   Their hunting expeditions became a synchronized ballet. Sniff, with his heightened senses, would locate game, herding them toward Og’s waiting spear. And Og, in turn, would reward Sniff with the choicest cuts of meat, a silent thank you for his loyal companionship. The nights were a sanctuary, a time for storytelling around the crackling fire. Og, who once had no one to talk to, found himself narrating his day to Sniff, his voice filled with a newfound warmth. Sniff, in return, would offer a soft nudge and an occasional happy bark, his way of participating in the conversation. But this idyllic life was not without its challenges. One day, a fierce storm descended upon the valley, turning the earth into a treacherous, churning mess. The river, usually a gentle stream, swelled into a raging torrent, threatening to engulf everything in its path. Og, with Sniff close by, sought refuge in a small cave, the wind howling like a banshee outside.   As the storm raged, Og and Sniff huddled together, finding comfort in each other's presence. Suddenly, Og noticed a group of other "things", like Sniff, whimpering by the swollen river. He had never really interacted with other animals of Sniff's ilk, and honestly was somewhat intimidated. Sniff, sensing Og's hesitation, began to bark with a determined, insistent tone. It was as if he was urging Og to not let those others suffer like he had. Og, moved by Sniff’s pleas and a stirring sense of responsibility, ventured out into the storm. He braved the rising water and helped the other dogs to safety. That day, the valley was flooded, and homes were ruined, but friendships were made, and from that day forward the bond between man and dog was forever solidified. The storm had passed, leaving behind a valley washed clean, and a friendship deepened. It was indeed a special time, a period of growth, discovery, and the blossoming of a bond that would echo through the ages.  A lifetime, give or take a few seasons, unfurled from the heart of their friendship. Og hadn't been much older than a cub himself when he'd first met Sniff. The world felt vast and daunting back then, but with Sniff at his side, each season shed its fears like a shedding snake’s skin.

It was during one of these sun-drenched seasons that Og, now a lanky young man of barely sixteen summers, encountered a sight that turned his heady dreams to vibrant reality –  Ug. She moved with the lithe grace of a forest cat, eyes sharp and intelligent as she expertly navigated the tangled thickets. Unlike most women of their nomadic tribe who heeded the elders' calls and settled close by for shared stories and woven tapestries under a star-filled sky, Ug roamed with her kin, hunting and gathering with an untamed spirit that mirrored his own.  Their meeting was a chance collision –  a playful chase transforming into a hesitant truce as they shared a hard-earned meal of roasted boar. A spark ignited between them, born from a shared yearning for the wild and a silent understanding woven through gestures more eloquent than words. Love bloomed under the watching gaze of the ever-present Sniff, a constant reminder of loyalty's quiet comfort.  Og and Ug wove their lives together, a tapestry vibrant with laughter, shared hunts, and the shelter of their growing family. The cave that had once held only Og and his faithful dog now echoed with the babble of small voices – first one child, then another, each born under a canopy of leaves whispered secrets by the wind.  Sniff found his heart-fur deepened too, not just for Og but for this vibrant new brood. He doted on their little legs as they fumbled to walk,  his tongue a perpetual offering of roughened comfort against scraped knees and tear-stained cheeks. But a shadowed fear haunted their sun-soaked days – illness could lay its grip on the fragile world of their lives with chilling swiftness.  One moonless night, disaster struck. A youngling, his name no more than a melody to their tribe’s tongue, was impaled while playing near a prickly thicket. Panicked cries clawed at the night as the wound bled deep and dark – an infection seemed a dreadful certainty in their world of earth-toned remedies. The elders held whispered councils, but solutions felt too distant against the gurgling whimpers of the child.  It was Sniff who answered the call when all others failed. He saw the boy's fear mirrored in his own fading memory of the lonely days before he met Og. With a primal urgency born from kinship and love, he  lowered his head, lapping at the wound – not water or herbs this time, but the warmth of a complex biological solution: the dog’s ancient and potent saliva. It wasn't just a comforting gesture; it was their world's unsung shield against microbial nightmares.  As dawn bled light across the sky, a fragile miracle unfolded. The wound, no longer festering, showed signs of healing. His cries had stilled, replaced by dozes that spoke of respite and life returned.  The whispers in the elders’ gatherings turned to awed murmurs – "Dog's touch saved the child." A forgotten knowledge was reignited, a primal truth passed down through generations: their world wasn’t just about survival - it was held together by unlikely alliances, the wisdom whispered on four legs and a love that bound human and animal in an unbreakable covenant.  The tapestry of their lives had grown richer, woven with threads of gratitude, a new understanding of their place within this vast, vibrant world, and a silent pact: to remember Sniff, more than just a faithful companion,  - the healer who defied fate itself, and whose legacy would forever echo in the heart of their little tribe.  Time, ever patient and unhurried, painted its strokes across their world. The laughter of Og and Ug's children had transformed from gleeful babbles to youthful melodies, then to heart-lit conversations shared beneath the watchful gaze of stars that whispered ancient secrets. Snow turned hair once sun-kissed to silvered strands, but love - a tapestry woven with countless moonlit nights – remained as vibrant as the first day they met.   Og and Ug, their eyes etched with a lifetime's journeys, found solace in their shared twilight. The cave, no longer a refuge from a world’s storms, now echoed with the echoes of generations past - stories spun like leaves adrift on the wind. Sniff, whose youthful energy had once mirrored his master’s wild spirit, settled into elder-dog grace – a muzzle lined with silver,  his steps less a playful bound and more a measured wisdom that whispered through their close-knit world.   One day, as if to mirror their life's gentle turn, fate brought a new current to their lives in the shape of Whisper - a sleek she-wolf who drifted into their valley like a melody carried on the breeze. Her eyes held the boundless expanse of ancient forests, a wild heart yearning for kinship. Sniff, drawn by an unfathomed echo within her spirit, welcomed her with a soft rumble and a shared watch over the rising sun. A love story unfolded beneath whispering pines - a dance of devotion that culminated in a joyous litter of rambunctious pups.

Puppies – those tiny bundles of boundless energy – arrived like a sunrise, bursting forth their joy into a world touched by silvered leaves and memories woven deep in hearth fires. The tribe embraced them with open arms (and playful hands), their small souls harmonizing with the elder-hearts. Life’s rhythm changed anew. A pack now bounded where once there was one devoted friend.  The pups, each imbued with a piece of their lineage – Og and his quiet strength,  Ug’s boundless spirit, Sniff’s loyalty, and Whisper's untamed grace - were the living embodiment of their unity. They learned to herd like their forebearers, to sniff out hidden bounty in the earth, and most importantly, to weave themselves into the tapestry of shared existence.  One evening, as a bonfire cast long dancing shadows across their clearing, a young girl – her eyes mirroring Ug’s youthful luminescence – nestled a whimpering pup close.  "Look at his soft fur, grand-mama," she whispered, "He'll be the best hunting companion I’ve ever had."  Ug smiled, her heart full as a woven tapestry. "Aye, little one, he will. And remember, our strength comes not just from spears or nimble hands, but from the love we share - with each other and all creatures who walk this earth beside us.”   Og, his gaze distant yet filled with contentment, looked at Sniff dozing contentedly, a symphony of playful yips ringing in their ears. He knew –  the world had held its breath for eons while the story of man and nature unfolded. Now, it exhaled, rich with the melody of shared lives, a chorus that echoed through each wag of a tail, each loving touch, and every whispered prayer beneath a sky teeming with stars. This was their legacy - a testament to the enduring bond forged where hearts met on the earth, and where a simple love for a loyal dog had blossomed into an unbreakable covenant that spanned generations.   Their story, woven in the threads of time and loyalty, was not just over – it had found its truest, most vibrant beginning. The pack and the village thrived, and with them, a world richer for the echoes of their shared journey.
