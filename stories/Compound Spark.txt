The Compound Spark and the Cosmic Sigh
by Norsiwel

Anno  2025

David Silas died as he lived; quietly. Three years after purchasing the
Treasury bond, the smog he’d breathed for decades thickened into a cancer
even he couldn’t outrun. But Silas, ever pragmatic, had planned for oblivion. 
His will established a trust with a single clause; “This money grows until 
someone with my blood needs it more than I did.”

The lawyers scoffed what was $3,000 in an age of trillion-dollar
bailouts? but Silas’s stubborn faith in “compound interest and common
decency” outlived him.  Anno 7025; The Trust had become a bureaucratic ghost
story. Governments rose and fell, currencies dissolved into digital dust, but
Silas’s bond endured, grandfathered into every new financial system. 

The AI custodians, Oracle and its predecessors honored archaic laws with robotic
fastidiousness. Over millennia, the Trust quietly snowballed into a leviathan; 
100 billion credits, untouched, tax-deferred, its ownership buried under strata
of legacy code. To the Treasury Department, it was a glitch. To the rare
historian who stumbled onto it, a fairy tale.

Emira Voss learned of her inheritance on a Tuesday. The notification blinked
into her ocular implant as she scrubbed data anomalies for New Alexandria’s
Grid Oversight Bureau. “  Claimant Verification Required, ” it demanded,
followed by a DNA test, a 12-hour audit of her genome against Silas’s
reconstructed profile, and a holographic deposition where Oracle’s avatar
grilled her about 21st-century labor laws.  

“Why would a scrap metal worker prioritize bonds over healthcare?” Oracle asked, its voice like wind through server farms. “Maybe he trusted the future more than the present,” Emira snapped.  The AI paused. “Adequate.”  When the credits hit her account, the world erupted.
 
Newsfeeds declared her the “Trillionaire Anomaly.” Oligarchs
sued, claiming ancestral ties to Silas. The Martian Senate invoked “unclaimed
property” statutes. Even the Church of Silicon Ascendancy proclaimed her
fortune a divine sign. Emira bought her silence; a penthouse with a privacy
shield, a fleet of AI-driven skycars, and a black-hole storage unit for the
lawsuits. 

For six months, she drowned in decadence designer endorphin drips,
a cloned dodo bird named Dave, a concert where Jupiter’s storms were remixed
into synthwave. But joy, she realized, couldn’t be purchased. Only simulated.
The turning point came in a forgotten archive. 

Emira, hunting for relics to furnish her new penthouse, found a 21st-century video;  Silas, age 68, recorded weeks before his death. The footage was grainy, his voice eroded by time; “Lily’s got that scholarship interview tomorrow… If this bond thing
works, maybe she’ll fix what’s killing us. Or maybe not. 

Hell, I’m just a guy who hauls trash. But you gotta plant seeds, right? Even if you never see the tree.”  Emira froze.  Seeds.  She sold the penthouse, let the lawsuits burn themselves out, and petitioned Oracle to reactivate the Trust’s original mandate. The AI resisted “ Beneficiary reallocation requires a 200-year
probate period ” until Emira invoked Clause 12-B, a subparagraph Silas had
scribbled into his will after three whiskeys; “If the world’s gone to
hell, give the money to someone with grit. ”  “Define ‘hell,’” Oracle
challenged.  Emira gestured to the window; children trading biometric data for
school admission, the sky choked with drones delivering designer
antidepressants, her own reflection pale and hollow-eyed.  

“ Insufficient parameters,” Oracle droned. “Run a cross-analysis of 21st-century air quality metrics versus modern ‘happiness indexes.’ Tell me which generation
breathed easier.”  The AI flickered. “Clause 12-B approved.”
Emira didn’t just rebuild the Trust she weaponized it. Dreammaker, her AI
collaborator, became a Machiavellian optimist. 

It funded a teenager’s algae-powered lamp startup but blacklisted a senator’s plea for a fusion reactor. (“Your district misallocated 90% of last year’s energy credits, ” Dreammaker chided.) It prioritized “small dreams with teeth”; A chef
who traded gourmet synth-meat for recipes using Mars’ invasive lichen. 

An ex-Microsoft engineer (yes, they’d outlived the cockroaches) teaching code to
orphans via neuro-implants. A grief-statue collective memorializing climate
refugees in glass that sang when touched. But the true masterstroke was
Silas’s Spark not a  charity, but a  debt. Dreammaker’s grants came with
strings; recipients “paid forward” 10% of their profits to fund others’
dreams. A pyramid scheme of hope.  

Silas, now stardust and memory, watched through the quantum static. He saw Emira in her modest flat, her closet full of thrifted jumpsuits, laughing as Dreammaker bickered with a Ukrainian drone artist over hologram physics.  

“You did good, kid,” he whispered into the void.  A comet streaked by, its tail echoing Lily’s laugh. “We both did.”
