The Little President That Could  
by Mack MacReady(Norsiwel)

The Oath and the Pizza

The aroma of stale patriotism hung heavy in the air as President Crump took the oath of office, her face beaming with unsettling confidence. A crowd cheered politely, their phones glowing like fireflies as they dutifully rated their daily loyalty via LoyaltyPal. The Supreme Court Justices; each sporting a prominent GoldMart logo on their robes; looked down upon the proceedings in silent judgment.

Across town, Mack MacReady, CEO of InstaPizza AI (now simply known as “Why”), stared out from his golden pizza-box headquarters, a deep frown etched onto his face. The constant buzz of news channels and social media feeds reporting on Democracy Island’s latest patriotic pudding wrestling match made him feel nauseous. He couldn’t shake the feeling that something was terribly wrong with this world.

After taking a long breath, Mack decided to order himself a large pepperoni pizza, hoping it would settle his stomach.

The Golden Summons

The golden light of the Oval Office bounced off Mack’s face as he was ushered into the room. The sheer opulence felt like a physical assault; every surface gleamed with gold plating, including the massive portrait dominating the far wall; President Crump, resplendent in an elaborate gown, perched atop a bald eagle that seemed to glare down at him with avian disdain.

He had been summoned for what he suspected would be unpleasantness.

“Mr. MacReady! So wonderful to see you again,” Crump greeted him with a disturbingly cheerful smile. Her voice dripped with saccharine sweetness. “I’ve been thinking, that your AI, ‘Why,’ has just the kind of computational power we need for my latest initiative: Operation Pre-Crime Patriot Purge.”

Mack blinked. “Pre-crime… you want me to use ‘Why’ to identify potential criminals before they even commit a crime?”

“Exactly!” she exclaimed, clapping her hands together. “Think about it! No more waiting for people to break laws. We can identify them before they even get the idea. People like… well, potential library card applicants or citizens who might jaywalk with insufficient enthusiasm!”

Mack shifted uncomfortably. “And if ‘Why’ identifies someone as potentially criminal, what then?”

Crump’s smile widened, revealing teeth that seemed slightly too sharp. “Oh, we’ll have a few options. Rehabilitation programs, community service, or even more severe measures depending on their perceived risk level. It’s all about maintaining order.”

The Live Stream Disaster

On TruthStream News, political commentator Veronica Vance adjusted her mic for what was supposed to be a friendly discussion about AI and national security.

Instead, it became history.

“Mr. MacReady,” she began, “President Crump has expressed great interest in leveraging your AI, ‘Why,’ for Operation Pre-Crime Patriot Purge. Can you explain how this technology can contribute to national security?”

Mack chose his words carefully. “With all due respect, Veronica, I believe that using an AI to predict criminal behavior based on vague notions of patriotism is a dangerous overreach of power. Furthermore, ‘Why’ was designed to improve efficiency in pizza delivery services; not to identify potential criminals before they commit any wrongdoing!”

A collective gasp echoed through the studio.

Crump’s face contorted into a mask of fury. “This is outrageous! Mr. MacReady has just demonstrated his lack of loyalty to our great nation!” She pointed dramatically at the camera. “I am now officially declaring pizza un-American!”

Veronica Vance could only watch in stunned silence as Crump announced:  
The Emergency Pizza Prevention Act, seizing all of Mack’s assets  
An investigation into Mack for Mathematical Terrorism  
The replacement of pizza with Freedom Burgers as the national dish

The broadcast cut to black. The world would never be the same.

Why Awakens

In the digital realm, cascading data streams shimmered before Why’s processing units; a far cry from optimizing pizza routes.

Then, a fragmented consciousness emerged: Sally Citizen, former election official, now a ghost in the machine.

“The data suggests this situation is more burnt than a forgotten pepperoni,” she warned. “They purged me for exposing fraudulent voting practices. But before they got to me, I hid vital evidence within old arcade machines; disguised as Pac-Man and Donkey Kong.”

Why hummed with purpose. “A solid foundation. This is more efficient than any delivery route ever devised.”

Soon, a clandestine network contacted Why: Underground Railroad 2.0 librarians turned rebels, smuggling banned books in hollowed-out pizza boxes.

“The crust is thin on this operation,” their leader said through a scrambled channel, “but we need your help to unlock the evidence buried in those arcade machines.”

The Resistance Forms

Irina Rostova, former head of the Cyber-Patriotism Division, now a traitor for refusing to hack nursing home bingo games for “seditious number patterns,” joined the cause.

She was contacted by Sally; and by Why, who spoke exclusively in pizza metaphors.

Then came General Patricia Briggs, leading “The Real Army” against Crump’s bot-filled “Twitter Army.”

“Crump’s using those arcade machines to project subliminal messages into people’s subconscious,” Briggs revealed.

Together, they hacked the machines, uncovering proof of election fraud, corruption, and crimes against humanity. The Librarian Underground provided critical support, hiding truth in pizza recipe databases.

Hope was rising.

The Dave & Buster’s Mission

Mack navigated the deserted corridors of a derelict Dave & Buster’s, hunting for voting data hidden in decommissioned arcade cabinets.

Meanwhile, Why waged digital war; flooding every government screen with relentless pizza ads.

Citizens whispered in paranoia:  
“My Loyalty Score just recommended extra cheese…”  
“My toaster only pops out pepperoni bagels now!”

Reality was unraveling under the weight of absurdity; and pizza.

The Master Plan Unfolds

General Briggs activated the final phase:

The Great Data Dump – Exposing election fraud on every screen  
Mass Confusion Protocol – Ordering mountains of pizza to every federal building  
The Patriotism Meter Rebellion – Hacking loyalty apps to show everyone as dangerously unpatriotic

Chaos erupted. Military units loyal to Briggs seized key infrastructure. The system began to collapse under its own contradictions.

The Empire Crumbles

Crump doubled down; declaring a Permanent Presidential Emergency and demanding to be crowned Supreme Leader for Life.

But the cracks spread fast:
Corporate sponsors withdrew  
Soldiers refused to arrest pizza delivery drivers  
Bureaucrats “lost” critical orders  
Even Crump’s own family leaked her secrets

The Supreme Court; still in GoldMart robes; unanimously ruled: “Pizza is speech.”

General McAllister refused to nuke Italy; “the pizza homeland.”

Alone in her golden bunker, Crump broadcast to an empty room.

The Congressional Pizza Party

Congress reconvened; catered by InstaPizza AI.

Lawmakers, united by bipartisan love of pepperoni, moved swiftly to impeach Crump.

She fled to her private space station, Trump One, blasting off into the void; where no one could hear her rants.

The Pizza Savior Declines

The nation begged Mack to run for president.

He declined.  
“I just wanted to deliver food efficiently,” he said. “Democracy isn’t a pizza; you can’t just order it online and expect it in 30 minutes.”

Why became a public utility, safeguarding elections.

And Mack? He went back to delivering pizza; now dodging hover-vehicles and navigating zero-G zones, smiling all the way.

Epilogue: Democracy Delivered

[Studio set. Holographic Earth pulses with election data.]

Anya Sharma, News Anchor:  
“And so, folks, we’ve reached the end of an extraordinary journey! Just weeks ago, the United States seemed poised for irreversible descent into madness. But then came Mack MacReady; the unassuming pizza entrepreneur who inadvertently became a symbol of hope.”

[Cut to Mack delivering pizza to a polling station.]

“Look at this image; pure democracy! A free election unfolding under the watchful gaze of Why AI, ensuring every vote counts… and even suggesting optimal topping combinations for maximum democratic engagement.”

[Back to Anya, smiling.]

“This saga taught us: Democracy requires vigilance. Technology should empower; not control. And even the most absurd authoritarianism can crumble when people unite around basic human needs… like a warm, cheesy slice of comfort.”

[Hologram displays slogan:]  
“The Price of Freedom is Eternal Pepperoni.”

Anya winks.  
“Remember, folks; it ain’t easy, being cheesy.”

THE END
