Upon the vast cerulean plain,
Where heaven and ocean interchain,
Sails unfurl 'neath the zephyr's kiss,
Bearing dreams across the abyss.

In cloth of canvass, wings outspread,
Whispers of liberty widespread,
The vessel glides with stately force,
Embracing the sea's boundless course.

With every swell, a ballet plays,
A symphony of winds that blaze,
Guiding us to shores unknown,
Where daring tales and myths are sown.

With helm in hand, the heart takes flight,
As waves and winds in sweet delight,
Compose a symphony so pure,
As this maritime ballet endures.

In this realm where dreams take flight,
Endless vistas fill the sight,
The spirit soars, unbridled, free,
Upon waves of boundless jubilee.

Oh, to be a mariner bold,
Where every gust a tale unfolds,
A canvas spread to catch the gale,
Sailing towards horizons, wild and frail.
