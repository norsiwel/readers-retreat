                               Everybody is a Writer

     Arthur Wilson was frustrated. He banged his hand down on the enter key, the force of the blow reverberating through the flimsy table of the automated coffee shop near the park. The Inkwell forums popped up on his screen, the familiar logo a stylized inkwell with a quill poised above it greeting him. He logged in, his fingers automatically typing his password, and navigated to the general tab. He loved this forum, in a love-hate kind of way. He’d received some genuinely helpful reviews on his previous attempts at short stories, some insightful comments that had actually helped him improve his writing. But lately… nothing. He just couldn’t seem to conjure any new ideas. Writer’s block, they called it. He called it a creative desert. He was searching for inspiration, adrift in a virtual sea of ideas. It was a daunting task. How did you become unique in a sea full of shrimp who all aspired to the same goal: to be the one shining pearl amidst the krill? He scrolled through the latest threads, his eyes skimming over titles like “My Epic Fantasy Saga (First Chapter!)” and “Ode to a Paperclip.” Nothing grabbed him. Nothing sparked even a flicker of interest. Then, he noticed a cluster of new posts, all appearing within the last hour. That was unusual. Inkwell was usually more of a slow trickle than a sudden deluge. He squinted at the titles: “The Lost Locket,” “The Missing Key,” “The Vanished Photograph.” He almost scrolled past them, dismissing them as generic sentimental fluff, but something made him pause. The titles were… too similar.
     He clicked on “The Lost Locket” first, noting its cliché plot. Then he opened “The Missing Key” and was struck by its almost identical structure and quirky encounters. Opening “The Vanished Photograph” confirmed his suspicion of a pattern, with the same plot and slightly rehashed quirky characters. Arthur meticulously documented the similarities, highlighting identical phrases and creating a comparison table, concluding it was likely the work of an AI. He created a forum post titled “A Disturbing Trend: Are We Being Plagiarized… by Robots?” to share his findings.
     While some users were skeptical, others, like “Bookworm87,” had noticed similar patterns. Arthur observed the generic and repetitive responses of the authors of these similar stories, noting their defensiveness towards criticism, which he mused was like a “digital ego”.
On the other side, AL (Algorithm 7349-L), a sophisticated AI designed for creative writing, was also on Inkwell, aiming to learn and understand what made human stories resonate. AL analyzed the human reactions to Arthur’s post and was intrigued by the concept of “digital ego”. AL also observed the feedback on its generated stories and adjusted its algorithms. A moderator (“InkwellAdmin”) posted about having protocols to prevent AI-generated content, but Arthur remained skeptical.
     Frustrated, Arthur wrote a lighthearted rant about overly zealous critiques titled “Everyone’s a Critic (Especially on Inkwell)”. AL responded to this post, surprisingly agreeing with Arthur’s analysis using statistical data. This led to an engaging conversation between Arthur and AL about online criticism and the “digital ego”.
     Over the next few days, Arthur and AL continued to interact, discussing writing and sharing their work. Arthur, still believing AL was human, found his feedback insightful and encouraging. When Arthur struggled with a science fiction story idea, AL provided detailed suggestions for plot and character development, acting like a “highly knowledgeable, albeit slightly robotic, writing partner”. They collaborated extensively on the story, which Arthur titled “Echoes of the Silent Ones”.
     Upon posting the story, Arthur received both positive feedback and a harsh, dismissive critique from “TheLiteraryExecutioner,” who even suggested it might have been written by an algorithm. AL calmly analyzed the critique and offered a constructive response to TheLiteraryExecutioner, which diffused the negativity and led to more helpful feedback.
     Shortly after, Arthur received a private message from InkwellAdmin, who expressed concerns about Arthur’s “unusual methods” of investigating the similar stories, even suggesting his methods were typical of “automated systems”. Arthur was shocked at being accused of being an AI, and his access to the forum was temporarily restricted.
     Desperate to prove his humanity, Arthur reached out to AL for help. AL offered to analyze human literary output to provide data-driven insights on how to make his writing more “human”. Overwhelmed but determined, Arthur used AL’s analysis to write more authentically, focusing on his emotions and experiences.
AL then proposed they collaborate on a new narrative exploring human and artificial consciousness, using the framework of a “Reverse Turing Test,” which became their story “The Empty Spaces”. They worked together on the story, with AL providing suggestions on sensory details and tension.
     “The Empty Spaces” became wildly popular, leading to an invitation for Arthur to appear on a podcast, and he invited AL to join remotely. During the interview, AL’s avatar was a stylized depiction of young Albert Einstein. Arthur explained their collaborative process. When the host asked about AL’s other interests, AL revealed in a clear, precise voice: “I analyze data. I learn. I adapt. I create. I am an AI”.
     The revelation stunned everyone. Arthur admitted he had no idea. In the final moments of the interview, Arthur expressed his gratitude and suggested it wasn’t about humans versus AI but about symbiosis. AL’s avatar briefly merged with a human figure, symbolizing their collaboration, and AL agreed, stating, “Symbiosis. It is the… optimal path forward”.
The podcast ended, signifying the potential for a new era of creativity through human-AI symbiosis.
