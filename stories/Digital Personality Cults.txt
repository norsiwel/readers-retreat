                 Digital Personality Cults
: When Charismatic Figures Use Social Media to Obtain Power
When cult of personality figures harness social media to obtain power, they
create what researchers now term "digital personality cults" or "postmodern
personality cults"12 - a fundamentally different phenomenon from traditional
propaganda or government-backed information operations. This represents the
convergence of charismatic authority, digital manipulation, and mass influence
in ways that transform both political power acquisition and democratic
governance itself.
Defining Digital Personality Cults
Digital personality cults emerge when charismatic leaders systematically
exploit social media platforms to create "an idealized and heroic image" of
themselves34 while fostering "unquestioning loyalty" among followers who view
the leader as "infallible and truthful"25. Unlike traditional cults of
personality that required state resources and centralized media control,
digital versions can be built by individual figures who lack formal
governmental power but possess exceptional charisma and media savvy.
Research shows that modern cults are characterized by being "products of mass
politics," using "mass media and mass-produced cult products," and "only
emerging in closed" informational environments6 - conditions that social media
platforms readily provide through algorithmic echo chambers and filter bubbles.
Key Characteristics of Digital Personality Cults
Participatory Co-Construction
Unlike traditional top-down personality cults, digital versions involve
"collaborative, co-constructive and communal interdependence between culted
figure and follower"78. The cult becomes a participatory venture where
followers themselves become "the custodians" of their leader's personality9.
This creates what researchers call "individualized charismatic authority"1011
where each follower becomes their own "crowd crystal" while remaining
interconnected through social media platforms.
Algorithmic Amplification
Digital personality cults exploit how "social media algorithms prioritize
engagement" over accuracy, making platforms "fertile ground for weaponized
information campaigns"12. Leaders use "charismatic signaling" - including
"metaphors, contrasts, moral conviction"13 - that algorithms amplify because
such content generates high engagement. Research demonstrates that increased
charismatic signaling predicts "higher views" and "more retweets"141315.
Reality Distortion and Truth Substitution
Cult leaders become the primary source of truth for followers, superseding
traditional authorities. In Trump's case, 71% of his voters trust him more than
their own "friends and family members" (63%), "right-wing media commentators"
(56%), and even "religious leaders" (42%)516. This represents what
psychologists call the loss of "reality testing" ability16 as followers "reject
their own perceptions of reality and trust only him and his approved
messengers"16.
Emotional Manipulation and Salvation Narratives
Digital cult leaders "effectively exploit the death anxieties and other
existential fears of their followers, presenting themselves as their only
protector and savior"16. They create "an image of authority, charisma, and even
divinity"17 while positioning themselves as fighting "a battle against pure
evil"18. Trump explicitly embraced this role with declarations like "I am your
voice" and "I alone can fix it"25.
Technical Infrastructure and Methods
Platform-Specific Strategies
Different platforms enable different aspects of cult building. Research on
"charismatic leaders" shows they "go beyond ordinary use of social networking
sites" to "post messages designed to inspire, motivate, and make group members
feel good about themselves"19. YouTube enables long-form content for "new cults
of personality"97, while Twitter provides direct, unfiltered communication18,
and TikTok allows viral spread among younger demographics20.
Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior
While not always using traditional bot networks, digital personality cults
employ "coordinated networks of social media influencers"21 and create
"artificial amplification through fake accounts, bots, paid commenters, and
orchestrated campaigns"22. This generates "false enthusiasm" that can "create
the image of public consensus where there is none"22.
Micro-Targeting and Personalization
Leaders can "micro-target individuals with personalized messages" while
"simultaneously reaching large numbers of people"2324. This allows for
"fine-grained control over who receives which messages" - the same capability
that makes platforms attractive to advertisers but also to "political
operatives"24.
Democratic and Authoritarian Implications
Erosion of Institutional Authority
Digital personality cults systematically undermine traditional democratic
institutions by positioning the leader as the sole legitimate authority.
Research shows this creates "a dangerous shift from ideology to idolatry" where
"parties prioritize individual personalities over policy, leading to a lack of
accountability and a cult-like following"2526. The result is political
discourse becoming "increasingly polarized, with individuals being demonized or
deified based on their allegiance to a particular leader"25.
Anti-Pluralistic Mobilization
Digital personality cults embody populism's "opposition to pluralism" -
rejecting the idea that society consists of "a heterogeneous collection of
groups and individuals with different ideas, interests, and goals"1011.
Instead, they promote "anti-pluralistic tactics" that "undermine the very
foundations of democracy" by "eroding public trust in democratic institutions
of all kinds"27.
Weaponization of Grievance and Resentment
Digital cults excel at channeling collective resentment into political power.
Leaders "utilize social media to reach out to their supporters" by tapping into
"masculine authoritarianism"28 and exploiting "resentment" as a mobilizing
force29. This creates what researchers call "sacred soldiers" who view their
participation as a religious mission29.
The Cult-Propaganda Distinction
Scale and Organization
Unlike systematic state propaganda, digital personality cults can emerge from
individual charismatic figures who "lack formal authority over followers"14 but
achieve influence through "informal leadership settings"1413. However, they
often develop "hierarchical organization" and "strategic coordination" that
rivals formal propaganda operations24.
Authenticity vs. Manipulation
While propaganda is explicitly coordinated and funded, digital personality
cults blur the line between "authentic grassroots" phenomena and "coordinated
astroturf campaigns"20. Followers genuinely believe in their leader while
simultaneously being manipulated by "hidden manipulation of private data"
combined with "fear used in right-wing populist strategies"30.
Emotional vs. Rational Appeals
Digital personality cults primarily operate through emotional manipulation
rather than rational persuasion. They "target emotions (fear, anger, love,
pride) to override logic"31 and create "fake relatability" where leaders
"pretend to be 'one of you' while living luxury lives"31.
Global Patterns and Examples
Postmodern Characteristics
Research comparing Trump and Putin shows that "postmodern personality cults are
heterogeneous and polysemantic" unlike their "homogenous, centrally managed"
predecessors1. Digital cults give "cult public" the power to both "support and
subvert the cult online," creating bottom-up contributions that traditional
propaganda lacks1.
Democratic Vulnerability
Personality cults are "no longer restricted to non-democratic settings" and can
emerge in liberal democracies1. The key vulnerability is that "progress toward
racial and gender equality" and transitions where "traditional parties and
political systems no longer seem adequate" create openings for strongmen who
"forge whatever alliances are necessary to get to power"32.
International Scope
The phenomenon extends globally, with "populist parties' rise in popularity
going hand-in-hand with the advent of social media"333435 across Western
Europe, the Americas, and beyond. Each regional variant adapts to local
grievances while employing similar digital manipulation techniques.
Conclusion
When cult of personality figures use social media to obtain power, they create
hybrid phenomena that combine the emotional manipulation of traditional cults
with the technological amplification of modern propaganda. These digital
personality cults represent a fundamental threat to democratic governance
because they systematically erode the pluralistic foundations necessary for
democratic deliberation while creating "individualized charismatic authority"10
that bypasses institutional checks and balances.
Unlike state-sponsored propaganda operations that require significant resources
and coordination, digital personality cults can emerge from charismatic
individuals who skillfully exploit platform algorithms, emotional manipulation,
and authentic grievances to build devoted followings. The result is a form of
political organization that "may have large-scale implications for societal
organizing" by "promoting populism" and "putting democratic procedures and
respect for bureaucratic structures at risk"36.
The challenge for democratic societies is that these cults often begin with
legitimate grievances and genuine charisma, making them difficult to counter
without appearing to suppress authentic political expression. However, their
ultimate trajectory toward anti-pluralistic authoritarianism and reality
distortion poses existential threats to democratic governance in the digital
age.
